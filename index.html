He also tackles the complicated issue of identity and details recent efforts and successes in cultural preservation and language revitalization.<br><br>A personal account from the state's first female Indian lawyer, Margaret Treuer, tells her firsthand experience of much change in the community and looks ahead with renewed cultural strength and hope for the first people of Minnesota.</p><p></p><h2>The Last Word</h2><p>While showing how both evangelicals and liberals misread Scripture, a leading Bible scholar and Anglican bishop shows how to restore the Bible&#x2019;s authority today for guiding the church through its many controversies.</p><p>&#x201c;But what does Scripture say?&#x201d; That question has echoed through a thousand debates in the life of the worldwide church in recent decades. All Christian churches are officially signed up to strong statements about the centrality of Scripture and its authority in their mission, life, doctrine, and discipline. But there is no agreement on what this might mean and how it might be worked out in practice.<br> <br> N. T. Wright, Bishop of Durham and widely respected Bible and Jesus scholar, gives new life to the old, tattered doctrine of the authority of Scripture, delivering a fresh, helpful, and concise statement on the current &#x201c;battles for the Bible,&#x201d; and restoring Scripture as a place to find God&#x2019;s voice. Removing the baggage that the last 100 years of controversy and confusion have placed on this doctrine, he renews our confidence in the Bible, and shows that the Bible can still be an authority that guides our lives.N.T. Wright is Bishop of Durham and was formerly Canon Theologian of Westminster Abbey and dean of Lichfield Cathedral. He taught New Testament studies for twenty years at Cambridge, McGill, and Oxford Universities. Wright&#39;s full-scale work, Jesus and the Victory of God, is widely regarded as one of the most significant studies in the contemporary Third Quest of the historical Jesus. It follows The New Testament and the People of God as the second volume in his projected six-volume series entitled Christian Origins and the Question of God. Among his many published works are: The Challenge of Jesus, The Meaning of Jesus (coauthored with Marcus Borg), and What Saint Paul Really Said.</p><h2>Spice: The History of a Temptation</h2><p>A brilliant, original history of the spice trade&#x2014;and the appetites that fueled it.<br><br> It was in search of the fabled Spice Islands and their cloves that Magellan charted the first circumnavigation of the globe. Vasco da Gama sailed the dangerous waters around Africa to India on a quest for Christians&#x2014;and spices. Columbus sought gold and pepper but found the New World. By the time these fifteenth- and sixteenth-century explorers set sail, the aromas of these savory, seductive seeds and powders had tempted the palates and imaginations of Europe for centuries. <br><br> <i>Spice: The History of a Temptation </i>is a history of the spice trade told not in the conventional narrative of politics and economics, nor of conquest and colonization, but through the intimate human impulses that inspired and drove it. Here is an exploration of the centuries-old desire for spice in food, in medicine, in magic, in religion, and in sex&#x2014;and of the allure of forbidden fruit lingering in the scents of cinnamon, pepper, ginger, nutmeg, mace, and clove.<br> We follow spices back through time, through history, myth, archaeology, and literature. We see spices in all their diversity, lauded as love potions and aphrodisiacs, as panaceas and defenses against the plague. We journey from religious rituals in which spices were employed to dispel demons and summon gods to prodigies of gluttony both fantastical and real. We see spices as a luxury for a medieval king&#x2019;s ostentation, as a mummy&#x2019;s deodorant, as the last word in haute cuisine.<br><br> Through examining the temptations of spice we follow in the trails of the spice seekers leading from the deserts of ancient Syria to thrill-seekers on the Internet. We discover how spice became one of the first and most enduring links between Asia and Europe. We see in the pepper we use so casually the relic of a tradition linking us to the appetites of Rome, Elizabethan England, and the pharaohs. And we capture the pleasure of spice not only at the table but in every part of life.<br><br> <i>Spice </i>is a delight to be savored.</p><p>There was a time, for a handful of peppercorns, you could have someone killed. Throw in a nutmeg or two, you could probably watch. There was a time when grown men sat around and thought of nothing but black pepper. How to get it. How to get more. How to control the entire trade in pepper from point of origin to purchase. In <i>Spice: The History of a Temptation</i>, classics scholar Jack Turner opens up the whole story of pepper and its kind like a ripe melon. He brings the exotic scents of the East deep into the history of Western culture.<p> Everyone knows a little bit of the story, how the desire to control the spice trade drove Western nations deep into the heart of the Age of Discovery, the Portuguese sponsoring Da Gama's push to India; the Spanish underwriting the many attempts of Columbus to get to India another way. The Western madness for spice was just about peaking in this time, and spice would all too soon become--gasp--common, much like the afterthought condiment it is for so many today. Who thinks twice about pepper any longer? </p><p> And yet, the history is long and glorious, and the window spice throws open on Western culture yields a glorious view. Jack Turner is a skilled tour guide and story teller. He starts his narrative with the 16th century quest for spice, then loops back into three mains sections of text: Palate, Body, and Spirit. Turner has mined classic and Medieval literature for any and every possible mention of spice and demonstrates how fixated the West became from the time of Augustus in Rome through to relatively modern times. He winds his narrative through the way spice was used in the foods of the wealthy (and puts to sleep the nostrum about rotting food), as a medicine, a sex aid, and as an aromatic channel to the gods of the time and place. He ably demonstrates the constant underlying tension surrounding spice--that it was both attractive and repellent, that it represented fabulous wealth and power for some and, for others, an abhorrence of the exotic East that exists to this day.</p><p> This is not an easy story to tell. But Turner makes it appear effortless. Pull a chair close to the fire, pour a draught of spiced wine, crack open Jack Turner's <i>Spice</i> and you'll read your way into the wee hours of the night. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p>Jack Turner was born in Sydney, Australia, in 1968.

An avid sailor and pilot, he lives in New York City, Florida, and Maine.</p>Woods (L.A. Times, 1993, etc.) offers a high-concept action thriller that never lives up to its potential. Just imagine movie titles rolling over a helicopter as it ``beats its way'' over Atlanta Federal Prison. There's a loud Dolby track of the engine as the camera pans the prison walls and zooms in on a crowd of nasty convicts swarmed around two fighting men. ``What's going on down there?'' asks Kipling Fuller of the US Attorney General's office. What's going on is that Jesse Warden, 6 3" and 220 pounds of toughness (maybe Arnold Schwarzenegger or Steven Seagal; forget Bruce Willis) is serving two back-to-back life sentences because a dead cop and $500,000 in drug money were found in the trunk of his car. He's spent the first 14 months of his sentence in solitary confinement because each time he comes out, he gets into another fight. And why are all these hard-assed cons after Jesse's blood? Naturally, because he's heat--a cop. Kip and his boss, the creep who framed Jesse, offer him a deal. They will let him go if he will help them convict a seemingly indestructible Vietnam vet who heads a well-armed religious cult in the Idaho panhandle. They will also get a letter to his young daughter, Carrie, who was adopted after his wife died of cancer. In the working out of Jesse's victory (he finds his daughter, gets the bad guys, and screws the federal government) there's nothing to distract us from the predictable conventions. Jesse finds romance with Jenny, his large-breasted landlady, who has a daughter named Carey. After the climax, a Fourth of July of plastic explosives, he flies off into the sunrise with his woman and the homonymic girls. Naturally, he pilots his own jet. Roll credits. Woods never keeps up the power of his hard-muscled beginning. But he writes fairy tales for guys that continue to find a market.

His previous books include <strong>A Forest of Time</strong>, <strong>Native American Testimony</strong>, <strong>Native American Architecture</strong> (with Robert Easton), <strong>Indian Running</strong>, <strong>Two Leggings: The Making of a Crow Warrior</strong>, and <strong>Architecture of Acoma Pueblo</strong>.Another quincentennial book--this one from the Native American point of view: a remarkable collection of 500 years' worth of Indian responses to the encroachment of white civilization. Editor Nabokov (Anthropology and American Indian Studies/Univ. of Wisconsin; Indian Running, 1981, etc.) draws on a wealth of archival sources--letters, government transcripts, newspapers, etc.--as well as some books for the 116 selections, ushered in by extensive introductions. Opening with prophecies of the white man's coming, the stream of entries soon turns black with blood and sorrow: the tragic tale so often told, but rarely with such impact as through these firsthand accounts. ``Brothers--The white men are not friends to the Indians; at first, they only asked for land sufficient for a wigwam; now, nothing will satisfy them but the whole of our hunting grounds, from the rising to the setting sun,'' warns the Shawnee leader Tecumseh to the Osage around 1810. One hundred and sixty years later, an anonymous Oklahoma Indian says, ``When the white man landed on the moon, my father cried...I told him there weren't any Indians on the moon, so stop crying. He said nothing for a long time. Then he said our spirits were there, too- -and he was sure Indians were crying up there, and trying to hide....'' The early chapters, covering up to 1865, were published under the same title in 1978. The new material, more extensive, brings the story up to today's plans by some Native Americans to protest the 1992 celebration of Columbus's arrival.

It begins in October 1900, as a teenage Pablo Picasso, eager for fame and fortune, first makes his way up the hillside of Paris&#x2019;s famous windmill-topped district. Over the next decade, among the studios, salons, caf�s, dance halls, and galleries of Montmartre, the young Spaniard joins the likes of Henri Matisse, Andr� Derain, Maurice de Vlaminck, Georges Braque, Amedeo Modigliani, Constantin Brancusi, Gertrude Stein, and many more, in revolutionizing artistic expression.<p>Sue Roe has blended exceptional scholarship with graceful prose to write this remarkable group portrait of the men and women who profoundly changed the arts of painting, sculpture, dance, music, literature, and fashion. She describes the origins of movements like Fauvism, Cubism, and&nbsp;Futurism, and reconstructs the stories behind immortal paintings by Picasso and Matisse. Relating the colorful lives and complicated relationships of this dramatic bohemian scene, Roe illuminates the excitement of the moment when these bold experiments in artistic representation and performance began to take shape.</p><p>A thrilling account, <i>In Montmartre</i> captures an extraordinary group on the cusp of fame and immortality. Through their stories, Roe brings to life one of the key moments in the history of art.</p><br><b>Praise for&nbsp;<i>In Montmartre</i></b><br><br>"Lively and engaging....[Readers] will find a fresh sense of how all these people&#x2014;the geniuses and the hangers-on, the wealthy collectors and the unworldly painters&#x2014;related to each other.....In [Roe&#x2019;s] entertaining, ingeniously structured account Roe brings Montmatre&#x2019;s hedyday back to life." &#x2014;<i>Sunday Times</i> (London)<br>&nbsp;<br>"With evocative imagery Roe sketches out the intensely visual spectacle on which Montmatre&#x2019;s artistic community was able to draw....

They performed on the dance floor, mingling with the punters &#x2013; aristocrats, celebrities, artists, boulevardiers and strangers; in those days there was no raised platform in the Moulin Rouge. In the daytime, on a stage rigged up in the gardens outside, there were open-air performances of singing and dancing, including makeshift ballets danced by the young Montmartroises everyone still called the &#x2018;little rats&#x2019;. To the side of the stage stood a model elephant, an incongruous exhibit left over from the 1889 World Fair, which housed the orchestra. It was at night, however, that the place really came into its own.</p><p>When the young Pablo Picasso arrived in Paris in October 1900 he made his way up the hillside of Montmartre to the lodgings he was borrowing from another Catalan artist before heading down to investigate the nightlife. At first, he was dismayed by the Moulin Rouge, finding it tinselly and expensive in comparison with the all-male taverns of Barcelona. He had been expecting artistic bohemia, not cavorting women. His Catalan friends, habitu�s of Montmartre, usually gathered at the top of the hillside, around the place du Tertre, preferring the shady, cramped little bars where they could drink and talk until dawn. Up there, in the heights of Montmartre, Picasso discovered the other, less outrageous popular dance hall, the old Moulin de la Galette, a real converted windmill where the neighbourhood girls and their beaux still danced into the small hours, as they had in Renoir&#x2019;s day. Here, artists such as Henri Matisse and the Dutch painter Kees van Dongen (whose portraits of women with elongated limbs, monocles and short haircuts would later earn him a central place among modernist artists) went to sketch the dancers. Nevertheless, it was not long before Picasso succumbed to the allure of the cabarets at the foot of the Butte, where prostitutes spilled out into the streets, strolling along the boulevards. They were among his first Parisian subjects.</p><p>A Spaniard, Joseph Oller, had created the Moulin Rouge on the site of the old Reine Blanche. Ingeniously, he constructed it in the shape of a windmill (competition for the old place at the top of the hillside), with eye-catching sails and red electric lighting, opening it under its new name in 1889. He commissioned a painting by Toulouse-Lautrec for the foyer and poached the dancers with the best legs from the �lys�e Montmartre. From the day it opened the red &#x2018;windmill&#x2019; became Montmartre&#x2019;s most popular attraction, even in summertime; when Parisians left the city for their country retreats, visitors came in from all over the world, gravitating towards Montmartre in search of cheap cabaret entertainment and lively nightlife. Behind the scenes, the Moulin Rouge traded prostitutes, but the visitors (and their wives) who patronized it saw only the surface gaiety and glamour of the place, enjoying the atmosphere of risqu� sensuality without taking any real risk. </p><p>As for the performers, they were unforgettable. La Goulue (&#x2018;Queen of the French Cancan&#x2019;) belted out songs celebrating the low life of Montmartre. Her replacement, Jane Avril, had been treated for hysteria by neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot in his clinic at the Salp�tri�re mental hospital before dancing in nightclubs on the Left Bank. She later grew bored of these and came to Montmartre, where she shook off her inhibitions in the Moulin Rouge, spindly legs flying in all directions. She was not interested in material things, she once said, only in l&#x2019;amour. </p><p>The poor, the displaced, those who had known destitution, deprivation and suffering, seemed to find a natural home for their talents in Montmartre; the district was already suffused with its own distinctive melancholy. Higher up the hillside &#x2013; up the narrow steps, past the small, tree-lined squares &#x2013; windmills still stood among the gardens and vineyards that covered the steep slopes. Though they no longer milled flour, it was to these that the Butte owed its distinctive, fragile beauty, immortalized in the sketches of van Gogh, who briefly lived there during the 1880s and painted the view from his attic window in shades of greyish blue. </p><p>In later years, Picasso looked back with nostalgia on Montmartre, where he lived out the formative years of his career and established the emotional foundations of his work. &#x2018;My inner self,&#x2019; he once said, &#x2018;is bound to be in my canvas, since I&#x2019;m the one doing it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Whatever I do, it&#x2019;ll be there. In fact, there&#x2019;ll be too much of it. It&#x2019;s all the rest that&#x2019;s the problem!&#x2019; The ten years following his arrival in Paris, he painted the world of Montmartre, seen through the prism of his inner life, responding, too, to the emotions and ideas of those who converged on the place during the first decade of the twentieth century &#x2013; Matisse, Andr� Derain, Maurice de Vlaminck, van Dongen, Modigliani, couturier Paul Poiret and writer Gertrude Stein &#x2013; each of whom became his friend. They were all inspired by the world of Montmartre, responding to the mood of artistic self-consciousness which had replaced the decadence of the Belle �poque and came to characterize the modern age. &#x2018;All the rest&#x2019; &#x2013; the plethora of challenges set by the changing social climate, their awareness of the art of the past, the technical demands presented by their rapidly emerging ideas &#x2013; would increasingly make claims on them. </p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>During the first decade of the twentieth century, art, as well as entertainment, was profoundly influenced by travellers and outsiders. Artists from Spain, Italy, Russia and America converged on Montmartre, providing entertainment, inspiration and fresh social interaction. Newcomers to the artistic scene were brought together by an unlikely nexus of brilliant talents &#x2013; including Gertrude Stein, Paul Poiret and art dealer Ambroise Vollard &#x2013; and the decade saw the formation of a new avant-garde. In the village environment at the top of the hillside, in muddy lanes and broken-down shacks, inspired by the circus and silent movies, close to the locals still dancing the night away in the old Moulin de la Galette, the leading artists of the twentieth century spent their early years living among acrobats, dancers, prostitutes and clowns. Their spontaneity, libertine lifestyles and love of popular culture contributed to the bohemian ambience of haute Montmartre and to the development of path-breaking ideas. By the end of the decade Matisse was exhibiting his dynamic works La Danse and La Musique, Picasso had shocked his friends with Les Demoiselles d&#x2019;Avignon, Poiret was dressing le tout Paris in garments inspired by the costumes worn by the performers in the Ballets Russes production of Rimsky-Korsakov&#x2019;s Scheherazade and every gallery in Paris was showing cubist art. How did all this come about?</p><p>The decade saw the emergence of major artistic discoveries as well as significant social change. In the years following the end of the Belle �poque, young artists weary of decadence and satire were already looking for new subjects and novel, more rigorous methods of painting which reflected their feelings about their lives. As an incomer, Picasso was fascinated by what he saw around him &#x2013; itinerant circus performers and acrobats, streetwalkers and the day-to-day life of those who lived in the shanty town that was the northern flank of Montmartre. At the foot of the Butte dramatic shifts were beginning to take place in the world of entertainment. During the years immediately following 1900, cinema took over from the circus as a major recreational diversion, and its progression from circus venues to designated spaces and the transition from the earliest silent movies to motion pictures with narrative, featuring popular screen stars, were also profoundly influential; the artists who gathered in Montmartre modelled themselves, for fun, on film stars and comic-book heroes.</p><p>In retrospect, it seems that, if the Impressionists had sought to capture on canvas a moment in time, the natural world en passant, by contrast, in Montmartre between 1900 and 1910, there was a spirit of iconoclasm at work. With the rise of photography as an artistic medium, the painters&#x2019; previous ambition of imitating life in art now belonged to photographers and, increasingly, cinematographers. The aim of painting was now to find ways of expressing the painter&#x2019;s own response to life, vividly demonstrated by the early work of Derain, Vlaminck and van Dongen, whose vigorous forms and bold colours would earn them the nickname &#x2018;les Fauves&#x2019; (&#x2018;wild beasts&#x2019;). With this decade, which witnessed searches for originality and artistic impersonality, came &#x2013; paradoxically &#x2013; vibrant personalities. New relationships suddenly seemed possible, between artists and their patrons, their dealers, their lovers &#x2013; and among the artists themselves. Those who gathered in Montmartre just after the turn of the century soon became competitive and sometimes combative, falling regularly in and out with one other, discovering, exchanging and strategically guarding original ideas. They sought personal freedom and innovative creative directions, yet they were not without nostalgia. In the &#x2018;cabaret artistique&#x2019; at the top of the Butte, everyone sang the songs of the 1830s, accompanied by Fr�d�, the proprietor (who sold fish, and the odd painting, from a cart in the daytime), on his guitar. The red-shaded lamps and rough red wine reminded the Catalan artists of home. More significantly, in forming new methods and ideas, the artists also drew on the art of the past &#x2013; El Greco, the Italian primitives and the classical art of ancient Greece. When African and Indonesian masks and carvings began to appear in Paris, the excitement they caused was heady, and lasting. </p><p>As the decade unfolded, artists continued to spur one another on, forming allegiances, making discoveries, sparring and changing sides. Derain and Vlaminck, still painting together in Chatou, a suburb of Paris, in 1900, began to follow Matisse; by 1910, the ideas they were calling into question were Picasso&#x2019;s. Braque was a friend of Marie Laurencin (the only female painter in their circle) before he began working closely with Picasso &#x2013; who loathed her. Paul Poiret, the first couturier to treat fashion as an art form and to compare himself with the painters of his circle, knew Derain and Vlaminck from the early days, when all three lived by the Seine in Chatou; within a few years, the designer was throwing huge parties, inviting Picasso and his friends to gatherings on the colossal houseboat he kept moored on the river. Gertrude Stein sat for Picasso ninety times (or so she claimed) in the beaten-up Bateau-Lavoir, making her way every week from the Left Bank to Montmartre. Intrigued and inspired by Picasso, she began giving her famous soir�es; then the artists came to her. Against the backdrop of continual discussion in the caf�s and bars of Montmartre, the subtle almost-feud between Matisse and Picasso played itself out in continual stand-offs and rapprochements as the world of artistic Paris evolved &#x2013; as Alice B. Toklas once put it &#x2013; &#x2018;like a kaleidoscope slowly turning&#x2019;. By the end of the decade, the Futurists were launching their plangent appeal for aggressive action, announcing &#x2018;a new beauty: the beauty of speed&#x2019;, calling for the radical renovation of techniques of painting and denouncing all forms of imitation. In Montmartre, much of what they dreamed of was already happening.</p><p>The years that saw the birth of modern art in Paris were those directly following the turn of the century, before the Great War. By 1910, Paris had become a hive of creative activity in which all the arts seemed to be happening in concert. The cross-fertilization of painting, writing, music and dance produced a panorama of activity characterized by the early works of Picasso, Braque, Matisse, Derain, Vlaminck and Modigliani, the appearance of the Ballets Russes and the salons of Gertrude Stein. The real revolution in the arts first took place not, as is commonly supposed, in the 1920s, to the accompaniment of the Charleston, black jazz and mint juleps, but more quietly and intimately, in the shadow of the windmills &#x2013; artificial and real &#x2013; and in the caf�s and cabarets of Montmartre during the first decade of the twentieth century. The unknown artists who gathered there and lived closely overlapping lives are now household names.

But with escaped serial killer Gretchen Lowell on the loose, the investigation into the murder of a DEA agent demanding his attention, and journalist Susan Ward showing up at his apartment needing a favor, it's going to be a long weekend.</p><p>Soon Archie finds himself crashing a masked ball on a private island owned by Jack Reynolds, a notorious local drug kingpin. By morning, Archie is back on pain killers, a guest is dead and Archie quickly realizes that little is what it seems. One thing is clear: Gretchen is back, and Archie's nemesis and sometimes lover has something special in mind for the birthday boy, something she's been planning for a long, long time. On Halloween Eve, with time running out, and the life of someone close to Archie on the line, Archie knows his only chance is to give Gretchen exactly what she wants. But Gretchen will prove more horrifying, and unpredictable, than Archie could ever imagine.</p><p>Back with her most thrilling novel yet, Chelsea Cain delivers the pinnacle of what fans of this series have come to expect: sex, murder, twists, dark wit, and some of the best characters in the genre.</p></p><p><p>CHELSEA CAIN's first five novels featuring Archie Sheridan were all <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers. Also the author of <i>Confessions of a Teen Sleuth</i>, a parody based on the life of Nancy Drew, and several nonfiction titles, she was born in Iowa, raised in Bellingham, Washington, and now lives in Portland, Oregon.</p>CHAPTER <br>1 <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Archie Sheridan had a paper birthday hat on his head and six bullets in his front pocket. The bullets rattled when he moved, making a clinking sound that no one else seemed able to hear. The hat&#x2019;s tight elastic band dug at his neck. He pulled at it, feeling the imprint of a ligature mark forming. <br>&#x201c;How was the bridge traffic?&#x201d; Doug asked. Archie guessed that Debbie had sent him over. <i>Go make small talk with the awkward guest.</i> That&#x2019;s what he was now, a guest. It still took some getting used to. <br>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; Archie said. He rolled the bullets between his fingers. It was a lie; the bridge had been backed up for miles. <br>Archie saw Doug&#x2019;s face light up and then turned to see Debbie coming toward them from the kitchen. She was wearing a white chef&#x2019;s apron and licking frosting off her thumb. Her hair was dark and very short and her body was strong and lean, though Archie supposed he wasn&#x2019;t supposed to notice that anymore. Doug reached to put his arm around her waist as she stepped next to them, but she gave him a quick look and he pretended to do something else with his arm. <i>No public displays of affection in front of the guest. He might feel bad.</i> <br>&#x201c;Archie says the bridge was clear,&#x201d; Doug said. He was tall and long-limbed, with light brown hair and a wispy beard that made him look like a graduate student. He looked ten years younger than Archie even though they were the same age. <br>Debbie gave Archie a knowing smile. &#x201c;Really?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;At this time of day? That would be a first.&#x201d; <br>Archie shrugged. He&#x2019;d grown a beard once, but it had just made him look like a rabbi. <br>He could hear the kids in the kitchen, but he couldn&#x2019;t see them. They had stationed him in front of a window in the far corner of the living room, while they frosted the cake. The apartment still smelled like the lasagna Debbie had made for dinner. There were dirty dishes on the table. <br>The window looked south, over downtown Vancouver. Archie could see the red taillights of airplanes lining up to land at the Portland airport, a barge making its way east down the river, the lights of the new Vancouver library, Fort Vancouver, a movie theater, a digital bank tower clock. Oregon was just on the other side of the Columbia River, a distant, indistinct horizon. Archie lived in Portland. He knew its topography, its skyline, its bridges and landmarks. But the view from Debbie&#x2019;s window was an unfamiliar landscape. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not as far as people think,&#x201d; Debbie said. &#x201c;If you can avoid rush hour.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Archie said. But the truth was, he wondered sometimes if she had moved far enough. He missed his family, but he knew that the farther away from him they were, the safer he could keep them. <br>Debbie&#x2019;s condo was on the tenth floor of a secure building. The kids didn&#x2019;t have a yard anymore, but no one got in or out of the building without being buzzed in. The elevators required a keycard to operate. Security cameras monitored the hallways. Two security guards were on duty in the building around the clock. <br>The kids could live without a yard. <br>&#x201c;Sara wants to be Gretchen Lowell for Halloween,&#x201d; Debbie said. <br>Archie inhaled quickly and coughed. <br>Debbie patted him on the back. &#x201c;I already said no,&#x201d; she said with a glance toward Doug, who was staring at his shoes. &#x201c;I just wanted to give you a heads-up. In case she brings it up.&#x201d; <br>Archie&#x2019;s fingers tightened around the slick brass cartridges in his pocket. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s seven years old,&#x201d; he said. <br>&#x201c;She wants to be something scary,&#x201d; Debbie said. &#x201c;It has nothing to do with you. Most of her friends don&#x2019;t even know.&#x201d; <br>It had been over a year since Archie and Debbie had split for good and she had enrolled the kids in school in Washington under her last name. It made sense for security reasons. It also required fewer explanations. Archie had been a public figure during the years he ran the Beauty Killer Task Force, but after Gretchen Lowell had kidnapped him and tortured him for ten days, he had reached a new infamy. Since her escape ten weeks before, the media had been revisiting every horrific detail. <br>Doug&#x2019;s eyes darted around for something to say. &#x201c;I hear you got a dog.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sort of,&#x201d; Archie said, not wanting to explain. <br>&#x201c;The kids are excited,&#x201d; Doug said. <br>Archie didn&#x2019;t need Doug to tell him anything about his kids, but he decided that now maybe wasn&#x2019;t the time to broach that particular topic. <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re ready,&#x201d; Ben hollered from the kitchen. <br>Debbie pressed some matches into Doug&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;Can you help the kids with the candles?&#x201d; she asked him. <br>He smiled, happy to have been given something to do, and pattered off to the kitchen. <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s nice,&#x201d; Archie said. He was making an effort to be pleasant, but he also meant it. Doug was dependable, good with the kids, kind to Debbie. Doug engineered wind turbines, a profession with limited exposure to serial killers. Archie liked him. When he could force himself to forget that Doug was having sex with his ex-wife and spending quality time with his children. <br>&#x201c;Are you seeing anybody?&#x201d; Debbie asked gently. <br>Archie&#x2019;s fingers tightened around the bullets, and for a moment he thought that Henry might have told her about Rachel. But when he looked at Debbie&#x2019;s face, he saw only tentative concern. The question wasn&#x2019;t loaded. <br>&#x201c;Not really,&#x201d; Archie said. <br>She frowned skeptically. &#x201c;What does that mean?&#x201d; she asked. <br>Archie opened his hand and let the bullets drop back to the deep corner of his pocket. &#x201c;It means I&#x2019;m seeing someone,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t want to talk about it yet.&#x201d; <br>Debbie&#x2019;s face brightened with pleasure. &#x201c;Is it Susan?&#x201d; she asked. <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Archie said. &#x201c;Seriously?&#x201d; <br>Debbie narrowed her eyes. &#x201c;Does Henry like her?&#x201d; <br>Archie hesitated. <br>&#x201c;Tell me she&#x2019;s not blond,&#x201d; Debbie said. <br>Before Archie could come up with an answer, singing filled the living room and Archie&#x2019;s children appeared, faces bathed in the glow of lit birthday candles. Doug stood behind them, guiding them forward, protective hands on their shoulders. Sara held one side of the cake plate and Ben had the other. They were dark-haired and freckled, baby teeth giving way to changed smiles. Every time Archie saw them, they looked more like their mother. <br>They finished singing, and Archie blew out the candles. <br>As he stepped back from the cake, he felt his phone vibrate. <br>&#x201c;Make a wish, Daddy,&#x201d; Sara said. <br>He didn&#x2019;t make wishes anymore. But he pretended. He closed his eyes. When he opened them, Sara was beaming at him. &#x201c;What did you wish for?&#x201d; she asked. <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t tell you,&#x201d; Archie said. He pulled a candle from the cake, and handed it to her to lick the frosting off. <br>The phone was still vibrating in his pocket. <br>Archie glanced at the caller ID. It was Henry. <br>He turned away from the cake, and answered the phone. &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; he said. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m at the Gold Dust Meridian,&#x201d; Henry said. &#x201c;Homicide. You&#x2019;ll want to see this.&#x201d; <br>Archie turned back toward the cake. Sara and Ben were plucking candles off and sucking them clean. Debbie had threaded her hand into Doug&#x2019;s. <br>Forty-two candles. Six bullets. Two kids, every other weekend. <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Archie said. <br>He slid the phone back in his pocket and looked over at Debbie. He didn&#x2019;t have to explain. She knew the drill. <br>&#x201c;Do you have to leave?&#x201d; she asked. <br>Archie nodded. <br>&#x201c;One slice of birthday cake to go,&#x201d; Debbie said. &#x201c;Coming up.&#x201d; <br> <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by Verite Inc. <br></p><h2>Mandie and the Ghost Bandits (Mandie, Book 3)</h2><p>Mandie and her friends try to unravel the mystery surrounding some missing gold, as Mandie continues to grow in her Christian faith</p><p>Lois began her first Mandie story when she was only eleven years old.

Among the other questions that arise are the difference between the right mind and the confused mind, what makes life precious, the nature of right-mindedness, the Buddhist paradigm of form and consciousness, and what distinguishes the True Mind. So succinct are the author's insights that these writings have outlasted the dissolution of the samurai class to come down to the present as sources of guidance and inspiration for captains of business and industry, as well as those devoted to the practice of the martial arts in their modern forms. <br><br>The history of the sword in Japan goes back to antiquity. Zen and its meditative practices also have a long history, but it was not until the rule of the Tokugawa shoguns, beginning in the early 1600s, that the techniques of swordsmanship fused with the spirit of Zen. And if one man can be said to have been the prime mover in this phenomenon, it was none other than Takuan Soho, confidant and religious instructor to an emperor, to a great sword master, and to the heads of the most important sword schools of the time. <br><br>Takuan's meditations on the sword in the essays presented here are classics of Zen thinking.</p><p><br><strong>Takuah Soho</strong> (1573-1645) was a prelate of the Rinzai Sect of Zen, well remembered for his strength of character and acerbic wit; and he was also gardener, poet, tea master, prolific author and a pivotal figure in Zen painting and calligraphy. His religious training began at the age of ten. He entered the Rinzai sect at the age of fourteen and was appointed abbot of the Daitokuji, a major Zen temple in Kyoto, at the age of thirty-five. After a disagreement on ecclesiastical appointments with the second Tokugawa shogun, he was banished in 1629 to a far northern province. Coming under a general amnesty on the death of the shogun, he returned to society three years later to be, among other things, a confidant of the third Tokugawa shogun.<br><br><strong>William Scott Wilson</strong>, the translator, was born in 1944 and grew up in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. As an undergraduate student at Dartmouth College in 1966, he was invited by a friend to join a three-month kayak trip up the coast of Japan from Shimonoseki to Tokyo. This eye-opening journey, beautifully documented in <em>National Geographic</em>, spurred Wilson's fascination with the culture and history of Japan. <br>After receiving a B.A. degree in political science from Dartmouth, Wilson earned a second B.A. in Japanese language and literature from the Monterey Institute of Foreign Studies in Monterey, California, then undertook extensive research on Edo-period (1603-1868) philosophy at the Aichi Prefectural University, in Nagoya, Japan. <br><br>Wilson completed his first translation, <em>Hagakure</em>, while living in an old farmhouse deep in the Japanese countryside. <em>Hagakure</em> saw publication in 1979, the same year Wilson completed an M.A. in Japanese language and literature at the University of Washington. Wilson's other translations include <em>The</em> <em>Book of Five Rings</em>, <em>The Life-Giving Sword</em>, <em>The Unfettered Mind</em>, the Eiji Yoshikawa novel <em>Taiko</em>, and Ideals of the Samurai, which has been used as a college textbook on Japanese history and thought. Two decades after its initial publication, <em>Hagakure</em> was prominently featured in the Jim Jarmusch film <em>Ghost Dog</em>.

In the state where the Reagan Revolution was born, there has recently occurred a remarkable progressive revolution under the leadership of another governor, four-term Democrat Jerry Brown. </p><p>Over the past several decades, as it has evolved from a red state to solid blue, California has boldly reinvigorated the notion that government is not a dirty word but rather an instrument for uniting people and improving their lives.</p><p>From raising taxes on those with annual incomes over $250,000, to shifting money toward the schools in low-income communities, from seeking environmental alliances with other countries to limit climate change, to the rejection of militaristic solutions to illegal immigration, California has been a laboratory of innovation.<br>Californians have rejected the "race to the bottom" right-wing philosophy that catapulted conservative politics in recent years. That model of endorsing privatization, deregulation, reductions in government spending, and a tax system that disproportionately favors the wealthy, is exemplified by conservative governors and rejected by the pragmatic liberal Jerry Brown.</p><p>In <i>California Comeback</i>, award-winning journalist Narda Zacchino, who has covered California politics for over three decades, clearly lays out the history of California's initial experiments with progressivism under Brown, its swing to the right under Reagan, near financial collapse under Schwarzenegger, and recent return to stability&#x2015;bulwarked but the progressive policies made possible by the second coming of Jerry Brown.

The compilation is organized by how a day unfolds, from morning's first light to ghost stories told around the campfire. Husar's love of all the things that the Midwest landscape had to offer jumps off the page with vibrant and emotional stories that entertain, teach, and inspire the future.</p><p>Longtime Chicago Tribune columnist John Husar knew enough about nature to appreciate its simplicity and mystery. He knew more than enough about the threats to the outdoors to become a tireless defender of habitat and wildlife. And he knew more than just about anyone about cooking strange meals that made his readers laugh and groan. <p>A Voice in Our Wilderness reflects John&#x2019;s insatiable appetite for life and good stories. During his 15 years as an outdoor writer, he took his readers on an intimate tour of the Midwestern landscape&#x2014;and beyond. </p><p>He backed up his opinions with action. He didn&#x2019;t just tell readers that crow or prairie dog tasted good, he gave them recipes. When he urged readers to save the environment, he told them where and how. He championed the creation of the bicycling and hiking trails of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, and he helped pave the way for the conversion of thirty-two thousand acres of army land into Illinois&#x2019; Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie. </p><p>Husar, who died in 2000 of hepatitis C, never fretted away a moment, not even when his liver began to fail.

He worked for several papers before arriving at the Tribune in 1966. </p><p>Over the years he covered eight Olympic Games, golf, and myriad other sports until landing the outdoors column, which he considered the best job at the newspaper. </p><p>Far from a traditional "hook and bullet" writer, Husar was an ardent conservationist and a leading voice for natural preservation.

His insatiable appetite for a good story led him to every corner of the Midwest to uncover more about camping, hunting, fishing, hiking, and simply enjoying the outdoors. His columns and actions directly contributed to the opening of thousands of acres of park land across the midwest; thanks to his work as a respected writer, he was able to save the bike and hiking trails along the Illinois &amp; Michigan Canal. His columns were also central to conversion of 32,000 acres of Army land into open spaces for the public.&nbsp;He was so respected by the outdoors community that in 2001 the Illinois Conservation Foundation announced the creation of&nbsp;the John Husar Under Illinois Skies Endowment, a program in which urban children are provided with camping experiences and outdoor learning opportunities at an Illinois state park. <b>Bob Verdi</b> is a columnist for the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> and a regular columnist for the <i>Sporting News</i>.</p><h2>Dancer of Gor (Tarl Cabot, Book 22)</h2><p>Doreen Williamson is a quiet, shy librarian on Earth.

In <i>Shadow of the Titanic</i>, Andrew Wilson offers a moving look at how their lives were affected by living through this catastrophic event.<br><br>For the first time ever, those who lived to tell the tale reveal how they coped in the aftermath. Using archival research and interviews with family members, Wilson offers a unique take on this fascinating story. He shows how some survivors used their experience to propel themselves on to fame and how others were wracked with guilt and refused to acknowledge they had been there. Some reputations were destroyed, and some survivors were so psychologically damaged that they took their own lives years later.&nbsp;<br><br>From the famous survivors like Bruce Ismay and Madeline Astor&#x2014;who became a bride, a widow, and a mother all within a year&#x2014;to lesser known survivors Dorothy Gibson and the Navartil brothers&#x2014;who were traveling under assumed names because they were being abducted by their father&#x2014;<i>Shadow of the Titanic</i> offers a host of astonishing stories that add an important new dimension to our understanding of this legendary disaster.</p><p><b>Andrew Wilson</b> is the author of <i>Beautiful Shadow: A Life of Patricia Highsmith</i>, <i>Harold Robbins</i>: <i>The Man Who Invented Sex</i>, and the novel <i>The Lying Tongue</i>.

There was a feeling of optimism in the air, a sense that anything was possible. The ship seemed to glide over a sea of glass. For first-class passenger Colonel Archibald Gracie, the RMS <i>Titanic</i> was a &#x201c;floating palace,&#x201d;1 a high-class hotel that cut through the waters of the Atlantic with a majesty and power he had never experienced before. As he stood on the first-class deck, he noticed that the sea was so level he could barely make out a ripple.<br> <br>Since Wednesday, when the ship had departed Southampton on its maiden voyage to New York, Gracie had taken advantage of every luxury. After all, this was a liner that had cost $7.5 million to build, a ship that carried 800 bundles of asparagus; one and a quarter tons of fresh green peas; 36,000 oranges and 16,000 lemons; 75,000 pounds of fresh meat; 11,000 pounds of fresh fish; 4,000 pounds of bacon and ham; 7,500 pounds of game and poultry; 1,000 sweetbreads; 40,000 sausages; 40,000 fresh eggs; 6,000 pounds of fresh butter; not to mention the 1,500 bottles of wine, the 20,000 bottles of beer and stout, or the 850 bottles of spirits. For the gentlemen on board there were 8,000 cigars, which they could enjoy while discussing the news of the day.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s not surprising then that on that Sunday morning, after a few days of self-indulgence, Colonel Gracie felt he should take a spot of exercise. He rose early, before breakfast, and played a half-hour game of squash with Fred Wright, the professional racket instructor, followed by a swim in the heated saltwater swimming pool. The exercise refreshed his body and his spirit, erasing, for a few moments at least, a slight uneasiness that hung over him. &#x201c;The pleasure and comfort which all of us enjoyed ... seemed an ominous feature to many of us, including myself,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;who felt it almost too good to last without some terrible retribution inflicted by the hand of an angry omnipotence.&#x201d;2<br> <br>Lady Duff Gordon&#x2014;the London-based couturier known as &#x201c;Lucile&#x201d;&#x2014;remembers how extraordinary it was to see and taste strawberries in April in mid-ocean, while another first-class passenger, Marjorie Newell Robb, was still able to recall in 1981, at the age of ninety-two, the feel of &#x201c;carpets that you could sink in up to your knees,&#x201d; the &#x201c;fine furniture that you could barely move,&#x201d; and the &#x201c;very fine panelling and carving.&#x201d;3 Many second-class passengers spent their time riding between floors in the elevator, which was described as &#x201c;a great new attraction on the boat.&#x201d;4 The tang of novelty hung in the air&#x2014;in fact, one could even smell it. In a letter second-class passenger Marion Wright wrote to her father from the ship on April 11, she said, &#x201c;It is lovely on the water, except for the smell of new paint, everything is very comfortable on board.&#x201d;5<br> <br>For thirteen-year-old Madeleine Mellenger (later Mann) the ship was nothing short of a floating miracle. She was traveling with her mother, Elizabeth Anne, in second class to make a new life for themselves in America. Her father, Claude Alexander Mellenger, a London journalist, had brought the family to the point of ruin through years of what she later described as &#x201c;his extravagance and high living.&#x201d; After Mellenger finally deserted them, Elizabeth was forced to take a position as a lady&#x2019;s maid and traveling companion with the wealthy Colgate family of America. For Madeleine, the <i>Titanic</i> became a symbol of promise, a sign of new beginnings. &#x201c;I could write forever about <i>Titanic</i> and how it changed my life,&#x201d; she wrote in a letter nearly sixty years later. &#x201c;A little while ago I started a &#x2018;Story of my Life&#x2019; kind of thing and I had to stop as it was running into dozens of papers and I wondered if I could finish it.&#x201d;6 That Sunday morning she remembers Charles Jones, the Colgates&#x2019; superintendent who did not survive the disaster, knocking on the door of their cabin on E deck and showing them a series of beautiful photographs of the family&#x2019;s grand estate in Bennington, Vermont. At eleven o&#x2019;clock the mother and daughter attended the Divine Service, which was held in the first-class dining room.<br> <br>Captain Edward J. Smith&#x2014;a distinguished, bearded man whose plan it was to retire after the <i>Titanic</i>&#x2019;s maiden voyage, following fifty years at sea&#x2014;led the passengers through the service, which included the &#x201c;Prayer for Those at Sea&#x201d; and the hymn &#x201c;O God, Our Help in Ages Past.&#x201d; After the service, Madeleine Mellenger remembers going back to her cabin with her mother in order to get ready for lunch and, as she walked along the wide corridor that ran the length of the ship, seeing a door open. &#x201c;I saw Captain Smith and his officers coming toward us in full regalia, lots of gold braid, and I knew him, as he looked so much like Edward VII, beard and all,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I asked, what they were doing and was told they were inspecting the airtight compartments and doors. That was his last inspection.&#x201d;7<br> <br>As was customary, Captain Smith and his men would meet at noon each day to take a series of sun measurements. With the use of sextants the officers were able to work out the precise position of the ship and, as a result, chart the distance they had traveled in the course of twenty-four hours. Those passengers who had bet on the ship&#x2019;s sweepstakes would then meet in the first-class lounge to hear the results&#x2014;the one who had picked the figure closest to that day&#x2019;s passage (which came in at 546 miles) could collect a tidy sum.<br> <br>The sweepstakes was just one of many diversions offered to discerning passengers on what was considered the world&#x2019;s most sophisticated ship. On board there were Turkish baths, a fully equipped gymnasium, a lending library, a smoking room, a reading and writing room, and a wide range of restaurants. The first-class dining saloon&#x2014;a magnificent room one hundred and fourteen feet long and ninety-two feet wide&#x2014;was decorated in a style inspired by English Jacobean houses such as Haddon Hall and Hatfield, &#x201c;but instead of the somber oak, which the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century builders would have adopted, the walls and ceiling have been painted white.&#x201d;8 The room had a series of &#x201c;recession bays,&#x201d; which in effect formed &#x201c;a number of separate private dining rooms, where families or friends can dine together practically alone, retired from the busy hum of surrounding conversation.&#x201d;9<br> <br>Many first-class passengers also commented on the grandeur of the main staircase, which measured sixty feet high and sixteen feet wide. The walls were covered with oak paneling, which, although simple in character, was &#x201c;enriched in a few places by exquisite work reminiscent of the days when Grinling Gibbons collaborated with his great contemporary, Wren.&#x201d; On the top landing stood a clock, flanked by two female figures, &#x201c;the whole symbolizing Honour and Glory crowning Time.&#x201d;10<br> <br>Not only was it the last word in luxury, but the <i>Titanic</i> was also a massive 46,000-ton signifier of technological mastery. With its revolutionary design&#x2014;the liner possessed a series of watertight doors, which its designers assumed would protect it from virtually every calamity&#x2014;a writer in <i>Shipbuilder</i> magazine of 1911 proclaimed it &#x201c;practically unsinkable.&#x201d;11 By the time passengers boarded the liner, less than a year later, the word &#x201c;practically&#x201d; had been erased from the collective consciousness. Sylvia Caldwell, who was traveling in second class with her husband, Albert, and ten-month-old son, Alden, remembers asking a deckhand who was carrying luggage on board whether the vessel really was unsinkable. The man turned to her and said, &#x201c;God himself could not sink this ship.&#x201d;12 Captain Smith, in an interview five years before his final voyage aboard the <i>Titanic,</i> stated, &#x201c;I cannot imagine any condition which would cause a ship to founder. I cannot conceive of any vital disaster happening. ... Modern shipbuilding has gone beyond that.&#x201d;13<br> <br>The ship was enveloped by a sense of safety and security. In fact, the vessel was seen by many passengers to be a symbol of social order. The liner&#x2019;s passengers were stratified by class&#x2014;the third class at the bottom of the ship, the second in the middle, the first at the top&#x2014;and, for the most part, did not mix with one another. Each person was content with his or her place: those in third class knew better than to aspire upward, those in first would not dream of looking down below. These were days when, for the majority, God was still in his heaven and everything was right with the world.<br> <br>As seventeen-year-old Jack Thayer, an American who had been visiting Europe with his parents, wrote in a privately printed memoir in 1940, &#x201c;Upon rising in the morning, we looked forward to a normal day of customary business progress. The conservative morning paper seldom had headlines larger than half an inch. Upon reaching the breakfast table, our perusal of the morning paper was slow and deliberate. We did not nervously clutch for it, and rapidly scan the glaring headlines, as we are inclined to do today. Nothing was revealed in the morning, the trend of which was not known the night before. ... There was peace, and the world had an even tenor to its ways.&#x201d;14<br> <br>That Sunday in April 1912, Jack could see his future mapped out as plain as the clear, straight line of the distant horizon. After graduating from the Haverford School outside Philadelphia, he would attend Princeton, then travel in Europe, returning home to America to practice private or commercial banking. As he said, &#x201c;It could be planned. It was planned. It was a certainty.&#x201d;15<br> <br>He spent most of the day walking around the deck with his mother, Marian, and his father, John Borland Thayer, who was second vice president of the Pennsylvania Railroad. The family stopped for short conversations with various acquaintances such as Thomas Andrews, the ship&#x2019;s chief designer; J. Bruce Ismay, the chairman of the White Star Line; and Charles M. Hays, the president of the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada. Like many passengers, Jack noticed that, as the afternoon wore on, the temperature seemed to plummet. &#x201c;I remember Mr. Ismay showing us a wire regarding the presence of ice and that we would not reach that position until around 9 p.m.,&#x201d; he said.16<br> <br>Ismay had been given the wire by Captain Smith just before lunch, during which first-class passengers could choose from filets of brill, egg � l&#x2019;Argenteuil, grilled mutton chops, or, from the buffet, salmon mayonnaise, potted shrimps, Norwegian anchovies, roast beef, veal and ham pie, corned ox tongue, galantine of chicken, and a selection of cheeses including Gorgonzola, Camembert, and Cheddar. The message had been sent by the <i>Baltic,</i> another White Star Line ship. Transmitted at 11:52 a.m., the message read: &#x201c;Have had moderate, variable winds and clear, fine weather since leaving. Greek steamer &#x2018;Athenai&#x2019; reports passing icebergs and large quantity of field ice today in latitude 41.51 N., longitude 49.52 W.&#x201d;17<br> <br>Ismay did not seem unduly worried about the threat of icebergs. When he met Marian Thayer and her friend, Emily Ryerson, later that afternoon, he seemed animated and excited. According to Emily Ryerson&#x2019;s statement, dated April 18, 1913, after a short, polite conversation about the suitability of their accommodation, Ismay took the Marconigram from his pocket and brandished it with a flourish at the two women. The gesture was motivated, according to Marian Thayer, by a need to show the two socially prominent passengers &#x201c;who he was.&#x201d; This sense was reinforced by Mrs. Ryerson, who stated, &#x201c;Mr. Ismay&#x2019;s manner was that of one in authority and the owner of the ship and that what he said was law.&#x201d;18<br> <br>The icy temperatures forced many passengers to stay inside their cabins; those in first class were fortunate enough to have staterooms complete with heating. Edith Rosenbaum (later Russell), a thirty-three-year-old fashion journalist and buyer, was so cold she remained in bed until four o&#x2019;clock that afternoon, at which point she decided to dress and take a short walk around the deck. As she stood by the stern she noticed the enormous propellers&#x2014;they weighed around thirty-eight tons each&#x2014;that churned up the darkening waters below. &#x201c;The foam whirled in a great cascade, made blood-red by the rays of a glorious setting sun,&#x201d; she recalled. &#x201c;It looked like a crimson carpet stretching from the ship to the horizon.&#x201d;19<br> <br>She then returned to her stateroom, A-11, to dress for dinner. In Edith&#x2019;s mind, clothes were much more than mere garments to warm and protect the body; fashion was both a source of joy and a complex language of individual expression. In addition, fashion was how she made her living&#x2014;on this trip she had with her a number of trunks packed with exquisite gowns that she had ordered in Paris for clients and businesses in America. Her original plan was to travel on the <i>George Washington,</i> sailing from Cherbourg on April 7, but her editor at <i>Women&#x2019;s Wear Daily</i> in New York wanted her to file a report on the fashions at the Easter Sunday races in Paris. She had discovered that she could book a passage on the <i>Titanic,</i> leaving Cherbourg on April 10, and she would still arrive in New York on the same day as the <i>George Washington.</i><br> <br>As she had stepped on board the train at Saint-Lazare station in Paris, bound for Cherbourg, she noticed a man and a woman rushing toward her, waving. It was Laurent, the head tailor at Paquin, the couturier on the rue de la Paix, together with the head tailoress. Just as the train began to ease itself out of the station they passed over two huge white boxes tied with tapes, carrying heavy lead seals, containing a number of garments that she had ordered, but which she assumed would not be finished in time. The boxes accompanied her on to the <i>Titanic,</i> boxes that, as she later remembered, &#x201c;were never unpacked and went down with the ship just as they were delivered.&#x201d; Before the voyage she had tried to insure her collection of clothes, but she was told, in no uncertain terms, that &#x201c;it was ridiculous to spend money for insurance when traveling on an unsinkable vessel.&#x201d;20 The opinion&#x2014;the invincibility of the vessel&#x2014;was echoed on the tender that had ferried her out from Cherbourg to the <i>Titanic</i>. As they approached what appeared to her like an enormous building, almost a skyscraper, John Jacob Astor IV, the richest passenger on the liner, told her that the ship had cost &#x201c;ten million dollars to build, and [had] emphasised that she was unsinkable, a miracle of modern shipbuilding.&#x201d;21<br> <br>Yet, as she had embarked, something unsettled her&#x2014;an awful sense that all was not right. The night before she sailed she had visited Madame de Thebes, one of the most famous fortune-tellers in Paris, who had told her she was about to endure a &#x201c;dreadful experience&#x201d; during which she would lose her possessions and many, many friends. At the time she had felt highly skeptical, but as she set foot on the boat she was not so sure. Certainly the ship had every luxury one could think of and was, as she wrote to her secretary in Paris in a letter on April 11, as big &#x201c;as from the corner of the rue de la Paix to near the rue de Rivoli. ... [It has] bedrooms larger than any Paris hotel room, and altogether is a monster. I cannot say I like it, as I feel as though I were in a big hotel, instead of on a cosy ship.&#x201d;22 She also remembered the words of an Arab fortune-teller who had told her, while reading grains of sand, that she would be in a &#x201c;very grave sea accident.&#x201d; She had been so troubled that day that she asked Nicholas Martin, the general manager of the White Star Line&#x2019;s Paris bureau, whether she could get off the ship. He had informed her that she could disembark, but her luggage would have to stay on board. &#x201c;My luggage...</p><h2>Brand Luther: How an Unheralded Monk Turned His Small Town into a Center of Publishing, Made Himself the Most Famous Man in Europe--and Started the Protestant Reformation</h2><p><p><b>A revolutionary look at Martin Luther, the Reformation, and the birth of publishing, on the eve of the Reformation&#x2019;s 500th anniversary</b><br> &nbsp;<br> When Martin Luther posted his &#x201c;theses&#x201d; on the door of the Wittenberg church in 1517, protesting corrupt practices, he was virtually unknown. Within months, his ideas spread across Germany, then all of Europe; within years, their author was not just famous, but infamous, responsible for catalyzing the violent wave of religious reform that would come to be known as the Protestant Reformation and engulfing Europe in decades of bloody war.<br> &nbsp;<br> Luther came of age with the printing press, and the path to glory of neither one was obvious to the casual observer of the time. Printing was, and is, a risky business&#x2014;the questions were how to know how much to print and how to get there before the competition. Pettegree illustrates Luther's great gifts not simply as a theologian, but as a communicator, indeed, as the world's first mass-media figure, its first <i>brand</i>. He recognized in printing the power of pamphlets, written in the colloquial German of everyday people, to win the battle of ideas.<br> &nbsp;<br> But that wasn't enough&#x2014;not just words, but the medium itself was the message. Fatefully, Luther had a partner in the form of artist and businessman Lucas Cranach, who together with Wittenberg&#x2019;s printers created the distinctive look of Luther's pamphlets. Together, Luther and Cranach created a product that spread like wildfire&#x2014;it was both incredibly successful and widely imitated. Soon Germany was overwhelmed by a blizzard of pamphlets, with Wittenberg at its heart; the Reformation itself would blaze on for more than a hundred years.<br> &nbsp;<br> Publishing in advance of the Reformation&#x2019;s 500th anniversary, <i>Brand Luther</i> fuses the history of religion, of printing, and of capitalism&#x2014;the literal marketplace of ideas&#x2014;into one enthralling story, revolutionizing our understanding of one of the pivotal figures and eras in human history.</p></p><p><p>Andrew Pettegree is Professor of Modern History at the University of St Andrews, where he was the founding director of the St. Andrews Reformation Studies Institute.

He was interested in people and loved to be in company. That was certainly a mercy, for in the second half of his life he was seldom alone. From the point in 1517 when he first registered on the consciousness of his fellow Germans, Luther was a controversial, divisive, charismatic, and inspiring figure; to some extent, he has remained so ever since. Those who came into his company seldom forgot the experience. Even in his early career the intense young monk attracted the interest of a number of influential figures who discerned in him a special talent. In later life, among his intimates, he inspired a passionate devotion. Thousands flocked to Wittenberg to hear him preach, or in the hope of attending his lectures. Those admitted to his circle of friends enjoyed the particular privilege of joining him at table, where Luther would relax and hold forth. This was Luther&#x2019;s especial domain. The day&#x2019;s labors past, he would sit with his friends and talk. Fueled by his wife&#x2019;s excellent beer, conversation would become general, discursive, and sometimes unbuttoned. Often one of the more eager of his dinner companions would make a record of his master&#x2019;s pronouncements; Luther, a university teacher for thirty years and used to being surrounded by note-takers, thought little of this. </p><p>Not all of what passed at table reads particularly well today. Luther was among friends and relaxed; he sometimes spoke to shock, and delighted in the outrageous. His jokes don&#x2019;t always amuse us. But the <i>Table Talk</i> is also full of profound, though unstructured, theological observations and acute perceptions of contemporary society.[1]</p><p>It is curious that, in this great mass of words, Luther said so little about his own movement, the Reformation. Between 1517, when Luther first attracted public attention, and his death thirty years later, Luther and his followers reshaped their world. Western Christianity was split in two, as it turned out, permanently. Families, cities, and nation-states were forced to choose sides: whether to remain with the old church, or to follow Luther into schism and new patterns of worship and belief. All this Luther accepted with remarkable calm. His actions had been dictated by God: the path he had taken was shaped by a higher power. In that respect the remarkable life he had led was not of his own making, but the consequence of patient obedience to God&#x2019;s command. </p><p>So it is left to us, in our more secular age, to reflect on the magnitude of Luther&#x2019;s achievement; but also, the sheer improbability of it all Luther&#x2019;s career was a monument to a towering talent, but it was also a pyramid of multiple improbabilities. There was nothing in the first thirty years of his life to suggest that here was an individual who would convulse a continent. It was extraordinary that a man who had built a steady and, for someone of his background, remarkably successful career within the church should suddenly repudiate both the institution and its spiritual leadership. It was even more extraordinary that he should survive to tell the tale.</p><p>When, at the height of the &#x201c;Luther affair&#x201d; in 1521, Martin journeyed across Germany to face the judgment of the German Empire at the Diet of Worms, he did so under guarantee of safe-conduct. Luther would be allowed to arrive and depart unharmed. But there were those among the emperor&#x2019;s entourage who urged him to repudiate this promise and have Luther arrested and executed.[2] Such had been the fate of another heretic, Jan Hus, a century before, and it was the fate that many of Luther&#x2019;s friends expected for him. Luther himself did not expect to leave Worms alive. That he had reached this climactic moment at all he owed to the stolid support of his own local ruler, Frederick the Wise, a devout Catholic who never left the old faith. He also, incidentally, owned one of Europe&#x2019;s finest collection of relics, the sacred remains that lay at the heart of the theology of indulgence that Luther denounced with such vehemence. Curiously he had never met his turbulent professor; it may have been at the Diet of Worms that he cast eyes on Luther for the first time. Many contemporaries found Frederick&#x2019;s protection of him unfathomable. Certainly without it Luther&#x2019;s career as a reformer would have been stifled very quickly. </p><p>Luther owed his notoriety during these years to another of the Reformation&#x2019;s extraordinary improbabilities: that a monk who into his thirtieth year had published nothing, and who shared the conventional education of other churchmen, should somehow reinvent himself as a writer and polemicist of astonishing power. More than that, in an age that valued prolonged and detailed exposition, complexity and repetition, it was astonishing that Luther should have instinctively discerned the value of brevity. Luther in effect invented a new form of theological writing: short, clear, and direct, speaking not only to his professional peers but to the wider Christian people. This revelation of style, purpose, and form was at the heart of the Reformation, as it will be at the heart of this book. And Luther achieved all this from a thoroughly incongruous place, a small, inconsequential market town on Europe&#x2019;s eastern periphery, a place that to this point had scarcely figured in the annals of European history: Wittenberg. This was in many ways the greatest of all the improbabilities of the Reformation, for which Renaissance Europe had no precedent. Europe in the sixteenth century was a society of rising nation- states, full of intellectual vitality. Its cities, with their churches, universities, and the new printed books, were one of the greatest adornments of this culture. But little of this cultural and economic Renaissance had reached the sandy, underpopulated plains of northeastern Germany. When Martin Luther first made his way to Wittenberg in 1508, he was not impressed, a sentiment shared by most of the small number of people who recorded their recollections of this tiny border settlement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yet this is how it turned out. From the time that Luther settled permanently in Wittenberg in 1511, his fate and that of his new home would be permanently intertwined. Wittenberg would become Luther-town (Lutherstadt), a title it formally adopted in the twentieth century. Wittenberg was the heart of the Reformation, and it shared and mirrored Luther&#x2019;s own transformation. </p><p><b>ON THE WHITE MOUNTAIN </b></p><p>When Luther first walked through the gates of Wittenberg, he would have found a modest settlement of some two thousand souls.[3] The great cities of Germany were up to thirty times this size; even in the locality, Wittenberg was dwarfed by Leipzig, the local trading hub, and Erfurt, the lively university city where Luther would spend his formative years. Wittenberg had first emerged as a settled place in the twelfth century, after a brutal struggle to eradicate the local Slavic population. To the settlers from the flatlands of Flanders called to repopulate the region, the gentle hills close to the Elbe seemed formidable enough. So they called their new home White Mountain, the Wittenberg, after the white sand of the hill and on the banks of the river, sufficiently shallow at this point for a ford. Over the next two hundred years this became a walled city, strong enough to defy a Hussite army during the Bohemian Revolt. But it never quite threw off the feeling of a frontier settlement, standing sentinel against the alien hordes. Significantly the largest cities in this part of Germany, Erfurt and Leipzig, were to the south and west, angled toward the cultured southern heart of the German Empire. It was from Erfurt that Luther had been dispatched to join the Augustinian cloister at Wittenberg, and he never quite forgot these daunting first impressions. He had found Wittenberg, he reflected some years later, on the edge of civilization, &#x201c;<i>in termino civilitatis</i>.&#x201d; Had it been only a little further east it would have been &#x201c;<i>in mediam barbariam</i>,&#x201d; in the middle of the barbarians.[4] Other visitors were equally unflattering. According to one traveler who experienced Wittenberg at about the time of Luther&#x2019;s arrival, it was a poor, unattractive town, with old, small, ugly wooden houses, more like a village than a town.[5] Not surprisingly, when Luther&#x2019;s views had stirred notoriety, these were sentiments his enemies were eager to echo. According to Johannes Cochlaeus, an early and dogged critic, Wittenberg was: </p><p>A miserable, poor, dirty village, in comparison to Prague, hardly worth three farthings: yes, in fact, it is not worthy to be called a town of Germany. It has an unhealthy, disagreeable climate; it is without vineyards, orchards or fruit bearing trees of any kind.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. dirty homes, unclean alleys; all roads, paths and streets are full of filth. It has a barbarous people who make their living from breweries and saloons, and a body of merchants not worth three cents.[6]</p><p>George, Duke of Albertine Saxony, enemy and rival to Luther&#x2019;s own patron, Frederick the Wise, put it more succinctly. &#x201c;That a single monk, out of such a hole, could undertake a Reformation, is not to be tolerated.&#x201d;[7] Indeed, one of the reasons opponents so underestimated Luther at first was because they simply could not conceive anything of importance emerging from such a place. </p><p><b>NEW WEALTH AND NEW INVENTIONS</b></p><p>The comparative backwardness of Wittenberg in this era was all the more glaring because the German cities were regarded, with some justice, as among the greatest jewels of European civilization. In the fifteenth century Germany had become one of the powerhouses of the European economy. While the emerging nation-states of Spain, France, and England expended their gold in dynastic conflict, Germany enjoyed comparative peace. Germany had its emperor, a member of the Habsburg family, who certainly aspired to expand his authority; but the Habsburg lands were too dispersed, and crucially, the emperor&#x2019;s own position depended not on heredity succession, but on election by a college comprised of the rulers of seven of Germany&#x2019;s larger states. These were the elite among the three hundred rulers of Germany&#x2019;s patchwork of small and tiny territories. Their borders were in constant flux. Saxony, where Wittenberg lay, could have been one of the largest but for a family tradition of partible inheritance that led to frequent divisions. Some of the grandest territories were held by bishops, true princes of the church such as the archbishop of Mainz, Albrecht of Brandenburg, a man who would play a large part in Luther&#x2019;s story.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By the fifteenth century many of the largest cities had successfully repudiated the authority of any neighboring prince: these were the imperial free cities. Nuremberg, the greatest of them all, had a considerable territory of its own; in southern Germany it coexisted in friendly rivalry with Augsburg, center of the German banking industry. Augsburg was also southern Germany&#x2019;s major news hub, a crucial staging post on the imperial post road linking Germany, Italy, and the Low Countries.[8] To the north lay Hamburg and L�beck, leaders of the venerable Hanseatic League of Baltic trading towns; to the west Cologne, Strasbourg, and Basel were strategically located on the Rhine, the great communication and transport artery that linked the rich trading towns of Flanders with Italy to the south. It was the connection with Italy across the perilous Alpine passes that was the lifeblood of Germany, for Italy was the gateway to Asia and its precious cargoes of spice and silks. The greatest benefits of this international trade were confined to the great imperial towns of the south and west; at the turn of the sixteenth century very little of this luxury trade would have found its way to the chilly northern plains of Thuringia and Saxony, where fish and grain dominated the local markets.<br><br></p><p>In the second half of the fifteenth century the sophisticated markets of Flanders, Italy, and southern Germany began to deal in a new branch of trade: the commerce in printed books. When in the mid-1440s a dogged Mainz entrepreneur called Johannes Gutenberg began to experiment with new ways to mass-produce books, it was by no means clear that this was an invention the world really needed. Europe already had a highly developed book trade, volumes lovingly hand-copied from manuscript to manuscript. Consumers and collectors would seek out their manuscripts from the best and most famous copy shops, or take their texts to the local scribe: this was a very flexible market. The trade in manuscripts would continue to flourish for many years after Gutenberg first exhibited pages of his printed Bible at the Frankfurt Fair in 1454.[9] Gutenberg&#x2019;s Bible certainly attracted a great deal of attention and quickly sold out. But it also bankrupted him. It was the last major project in which he would be involved.</p><p>Gutenberg&#x2019;s story, one of technological fascination and financial failure, would be disturbingly characteristic of the first seventy years of printing.[10] As news of his great achievement spread, princes, bishops, or town councils all wanted to have a press in their territory. Printing spread quickly through Germany, Italy, and France, and thence more haltingly to Europe&#x2019;s periphery: Spain, England, and Scandinavia. But most of these ventures, unsuitably located in small cities away from the major centers of population, closed after publishing only a handful of titles. It took some time for the fatal flaw in the business model to become apparent. It was comparatively simple to print some three hundred, five hundred, or even a thousand copies of a printed text. But the manuscript book trade, essentially a retail business linking one text with one purchaser, gave no hint of how such quantities could be sold in a marketplace spread all over Europe. </p><p>The answer, painfully derived after thirty years of expenditure and failure, was to be guided by those who had this sort of experience: the wealthy merchants who dominated Europe&#x2019;s transnational luxury trades. These were the men who knew what was necessary to make the new trade work: raising capital for the necessary investment and transporting books in bulk to major markets, where they could be traded, often by exchange, for other consignments of books. They knew how to arrange storage for many hundredweight of paper until an edition could be disposed of, and how to handle the complicated loans and exchange transactions necessary in any capital-intensive industry. </p><p>So the book trade contracted. Although books were at some point in the fifteenth century printed in more than two hundred places around Europe, two thirds of them were produced in only twelve cities. All of them were large commercial centers, strategically situated in Europe&#x2019;s major trading places: six in Germany, four in Italy, and two in France.[11] This iron geography of book production would prove remarkably enduring. Of the twelve great printing towns of fifteenth century Europe, none were smaller than thirty thousand inhabitants. This was true also of the two sixteenth-century ...</p></p><h2>A Marriage Made in Heaven... or Too Tired for an Affair</h2><p>The author of Family: The Ties That Bind . . . and Gag! turns her eye on the institution of marriage, charting her own wedded bliss from &#34;Living on Love&#34; to the stage of &#34;Get a (Mid) Life.&#34; 500,000 first printing. $350,000 ad/promo.</p><p>Erma Bombeck, one of the most popular newspaper columnists in the United States and the author of numerous bestselling books, died in San Francisco on Monday, April 22, 1996 from complications following a kidney transplant earlier in the month.<p>Bombeck had been ill for some time.

After working in a variety of jobs, he retrained as a solicitor and practised in Sussex, until becoming a full-time writer. Sansom is the bestselling author of the critically acclaimed Shardlake series, as well as Winter in Madrid and Dominion. He lives in Sussex. Discover more at www.cjsansom.com and facebook.com/CJSansomAuthorThis gripping new novel by the inventive C. J. Sansom shows that, when it comes to intriguing Tudor-based narratives, Hilary Mantel has a serious rival. Mantel isn&#39;t the only novelist to keep the Tudor flag flying in the bestseller lists. The first two novels in her Thomas Cromwell trilogy - Wolf Hall (2009) and Bring Up the Bodies (2012) - have won phenomenal acclaim as well as two Man Booker prizes. But years before she began that enterprise C. J. Sansom had embarked on a brilliantly inventive Tudor fiction sequence, whose five novels have brought him an enormously enthusiastic and widespread readership, too. Like Mantel&#39;s, Sansom&#39;s first two novels - Dissolution (2003) and Dark Fire (2004) - are set during Cromwell&#39;s time as Henry VIII&#39;s chief minister. But, in contrast to her mannered approach and enthralled fixation on Cromwell, his fiction has a far faster narrative pace and fans out across a much broader field. Ingeniously, it achieves this by combining a keen scholarly intelligence with the suspense and surprises of the detective genre. A Scottish historian who had a career in law before turning to fiction, Sansom finds an ideal protagonist in Matthew Shardlake, the humane hunchbacked lawyer-sleuth in his Tudor novels. He also finds the Tudor period intensely congenial to his imagination. Atmospheres of oppression and wariness, in which careless words or an ill-advised allegiance can be fatal, engross Sansom. Exploring different types of fiction, he has published two non-Tudor novels - Winter in Madrid (2006), a spy story located in the traumatised Spanish capital after the civil war, and Dominion (2012), an &#34;alternate history&#34; set in a 1952 Britain which is a dingy satellite of the Third Reich. Franco and Hitler loom over terrorised societies in both these books. In his Tudor novels, Henry VIII does so. A 16th-century portrait of Catherine Parr: Sansom is fascinated by Henry VIII&#39;s sixth wife. Sansom likes to vary his fiction&#39;s forms, and the Shardlake novels range from a closed-community whodunit in a snowbound monastery (Dissolution) to the quest for a deadly weapon of war (Dark Fire), a political thriller (Sovereign, 2006), a serial-killer story (Revelation, 2008) and a legal thriller (Heartstone, 2010). What unites them is the havoc wreaked by Henry VIII&#39;s brutal ideological vacillations, as the nation is ripped apart by sectarian fanaticism and splendours of ecclesiastical architecture are reduced to rubble ... Partly a detective story as Shardlake solves the how and why of the theft, partly a thriller with casualties mounting in the search for the book&#39;s whereabouts, partly a panoramic re-creation of the turbulent London of 1546, from the court&#39;s gilded warren of intrigue to publishers&#39; makeshift huts in the shadow of St Paul&#39;s, Lamentation is sure to give Sansom&#39;s many fans further cause for jubilation. Sunday Times Shardlake&#39;s back and better than ever ... The plot and pacing make this the best Shardlake yet ... it is a vision of how individuals find the moral courage to fight injustice which links the Shardlake novels to Sansom&#39;s other fictions, Winter in Madrid and Dominion. Lamentation, like its predecessors, is a triumph both as detective fiction and as a novel ... Sansom&#39;s deep feeling for the psychology of religious faith and for the defenceless, makes him, in my view superior to Hilary Mantel. Independent on Sunday Lamentation starts with the burning of heretics, and the smell of fear and dissent infuses the whole novel ... Sansom is highly skilled at weaving together the threads of his plot with the real and riveting history ... Lamentation is a wonderful, engaging read. The atmosphere of fear and suspicion is brilliantly rendered. Shardlake is always convincing, and he is endearingly battle-scarred and weary from his earlier adventures. The real characters are well drawn, especially Catherine Parr and the young Elizabeth, who makes a striking cameo appearance. Sansom cleverly keeps the king just off stage for most of the novel. We can sense him lurking in the shadows - a monstrously obese and malevolent presence. As the plot draws to a clever and satisfying conclusion, Sansom gives us a clue about where the king&#39;s death will take Shardlake; and it is a spine-tingling prospect. The Times As always, Sansom conjures the atmosphere, costumes and smells of Tudor London with vigour, from the gilded halls of Whitehall Palace to the dungeons of the Tower ... once Shardlake finds himself in real jeopardy [the novel] quickly picks up pace, all the way to a shocking climax that promises to mark a new chapter for Shardlake, and for England. Observer Sansom brilliantly conveys the uncertainty of the time when a frail young prince would ascend the throne with different factions fighting for regency ... Sansom has the gift of plunging us into the different worlds of the period: the premises of a struggling young printer whose only asset is his press, a dangerous possession when this newfangled invention could implicate the printer in treason and heresy ... There is a sadness about this novel which suggests that Shardlake&#39;s own world is breaking up - his great companion, Barak, who provides the physical strength the disabled lawyer lacks, gets into fearful straits - but it ends on a hopeful note for the many followers of this splendid series, which combines the imaginative insights of fiction with scholarly research. We see Shardlake carried safely downriver to join the budding court of the young Elizabeth, auguring well for his future. Independent So engrossing is the tale that I didn&#39;t pause long enough to take a note. Even when judged by the high standards of the earlier Shardlake novels, this one stands out - not least because it successfully maintains suspense for over 600 pages ... It is a mark of authorial self-discipline that Sansom wears his considerable historical research lightly, subordinating it to character and action. As in the earlier volumes, historical figures such as Richard Rich and the young William Cecil are successfully evoked without typecasting or self-indulgence disguised as empathy. There are also some memorable minor characters, such as the tragic and vexatious litigant, Isabel Slanning, who contribute to the sinuously-unfolding story in often unexpected ways. The orchestration of plot over 600 pages, and the final twist, is literary craft of a high order. Historical fiction - especially historical crime fiction - has often been regarded as a literary branchline, interesting and picturesque but not quite the real thing. This now is changing, and rightly, since the qualities required to evoke imagined historical worlds are precisely those involved in rendering the present. With the Shardlake series, and with this volume in particular, Sansom has surely established himself as one of the best novelists around. Spectator This is a terrific book ... It is a convincing account of a cruel and fascinating period and a very exciting read. Literary Review ...the Tudor Holmes finds himself plunged into crisis at the English Court...Sansomrecreates a fascinating era as he carries the reader along with Shardlake on his diligent andperilous quest, criss-crossing medieval London from the luxury of the royal palaces atWhitehall to the filthy backstreets of the city. Daily Mail ...a dark and atmospheric story... Shardlake deserves his wide and rapturous readership. -- Antonia Senior The Times Sansom has an extraordinary gift for atmosphere: he immerses the reader in the sights, sounds, smells and dreadful paranoia of life in the last days of Henry VIII ... Utterly gripping -- Marian Keyes Irish Times, Books of the Year Chosen as one of Antonia Fraser&#39;s Books of the Year. -- Antonia Fraser This, the sixth of CJ Sansom&#39;s Shardlake novels, unsurprisingly went straight to the top of the bestseller list as soon as it was published. Such is their reputation. Every book is a delight, and each one that little bit better than the last... Sansom&#39;s skill as a writer , coupled with his exhaustive research, makes readers feel as if they are living in the period he is writing about. Hilary Mantel may gobble up the big literary prizes for her explorations of the complex mind of Shardlake&#39;s old boss, Thomas Cromwell, but when it comes to recreating the authentic atmosphere of 500 years ago Sansom wins hands down. -- Nigel Nelson Tribune</p><h2>The Collector&#39;s Encyclopedia of Pattern Glass</h2><p>Depicts the patterns of pressed glass pitchers, bowls, salt shakers, plates, butter dishes, and other tableware ranging from the middle of the 1800s to World War I</p><p></p><h2>Vineyard Chill: A Martha&#39;s Vineyard Mystery (Martha&#39;s Vineyard Mysteries)</h2><p>A final installment of the popular series by the late author of Vineyard Stalker finds J.W.&#39;s happy domesticity with Zee and the kids disrupted by a surprising call from a reckless old friend who needs help hiding from would-be assailants, a situation with ties to a beautiful woman&#39;s disappearance. 35,000 first printing.</p><p>The late <b>Philip R.

"Bill Murray's 'My Life Without God' was a seminally important book for me when I first read it in the early 1980s," Farah said. "I was a young journalist drifting further and further from my left-wing and secular worldview. I was horrified by Bill's vivid and no-holds-barred description of his early life in the home of his famous atheist mother. It made me realize the importance of functional families and transcendent values. It's also such a hopeful book because if Bill Murray could overcome that experience and find salvation, indeed any of us can.

In familiar heavy-lined drawings, brightly colored with transparent inks on rich ivory paper, his teeny tiny woman expresses emotions from delight to terror with her simple dot eyes and flat features. Bennett's retelling closely follows that in Joseph Jacobs' 1898 collection English Fairy Tales (Dover), regrettably changing bonnet to hat, but otherwise changes are minor as the teeny tiny woman finds the teeny tiny bone, puts it in her teeny tiny cupboard and finally surrenders it to its rightful owner. Unfortunately, there are no objects in the illustrations with which to compare the teeny tininess of the woman as there are in Barbara Seuling's version (Viking, 1976). However, dePaola adds ghosts and splendid bright colors in his pictures. It's hard to compare dePaola's interpretation with Paul Galdone's (Clarion, 1984) for his drawings are as typically Galdone as dePaola's are dePaola. Either or both would be worthy additions to picture book collections.Virginia Opocensky, Lincoln City Libs . , Nebr.<br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.This old English ghost storyabout the teeny tiny woman who found a teeny tiny bone and took it home to make souphas been retold, almost identically (and with almost an identical titleTeeny Tiny Woman, by Barbara Seuling, Paul Galdone and others, and now by Bennett. The rhythmic words are wonderful for reading aloud, and the story builds as the voice from the cupboards repeats, each time slightly louder, "Give me my bone!" DePaola's illustrations are colorful, cheerful and childlike, but a bit static, and lack both the eeriness and expressiveness of Galdone's pictures and the teeny tiny coziness of Seuling's artwork. Wide-eyed ghosts follow the teeny tiny woman around, from the first pages to the moment when one of them snatches back his bone, but these don't impart any new meaning to the story.

No other writer so completely captivated the intellectual life of late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Europe, putting into language the anxieties and ambitions of a civilization on the cusp of modernity. A literary celebrity by the age of twenty-five, Goethe, who was born in Frankfurt in 1749, attracted the adulation and respect of the greatest scientists, politicians, composers, and philosophers of his day. Schoolboys dressed like his fictional characters. Napoleon read his first novel obsessively. He was an astoundingly prolific writer, a master of many genres, from poetry to scientific treatises, from novels like the tragic <em>Sorrows of Young Werther</em> to dramatic works like <em>Faust</em>. Indeed, Goethe&#x2019;s unparalleled literary output would come to define the Romantic age.</p><p>R�diger Safranski&#x2019;s <em>Goethe: Life as a Work of Art</em> is the first definitive biography in a generation to tell the larger-than-life story of the writer considered to be the Shakespeare of German literature. Drawing upon the trove of letters, diaries, and notebooks Goethe left behind, as well as correspondence and criticism from Goethe&#x2019;s contemporaries, Safranski weaves a rich tale of Europe in the throes of revolution and of the man whose ideas heralded a new era.</p><p>Safranski&#x2019;s monumental biography is a careful survey of Goethe&#x2019;s wide-ranging genius. Beyond his incredible literary gifts, Goethe was intensely interested in natural science and took seriously his official post as a statesman, working tirelessly to ensure that the working poor received wages and daily bread. With grace and nuance, Safranski crafts a portrait of Goethe&#x2019;s inner life that illuminates both his written work and the turmoil and triumphs of his era. Safranski shows that reading Goethe affords not simply an encounter with a literary virtuoso but an opportunity to develop a deeper appreciation of the human condition.</p><p>Goethe was writing in the midst of a dramatic and bloody time for Europe: the revolutions in France and America overturned the old regimes and introduced new ways of thinking about the world. Set against this backdrop, Goethe&#x2019;s life and work serve as an essential touchstone for the birth of the modern age. But as Safranski ultimately shows, Goethe&#x2019;s greatest creation was not only his literary masterpieces but his very life.</p></p><p><p><strong>R�diger Safranski</strong> is a German philosopher and writer, and the author of biographies of Friedrich Schiller, E.

Safranski&#x2019;s strength lies in his ability to blend artistic analysis with swift, sharp renderings of various artists, thinkers, pietists, lovers, and plundering solders who shaped Goethe.

The decorated cookie has arrived! Don't get me wrong. I love cute cupcakes as much as the next baker, but can we be frank? They've hogged the spotlight for far too long, don't you think?!<br><br>The present of a lovely decorated cookie is truly transcendent.&nbsp; We all know this instinctively. We bask in its fragrance as it takes shape in the oven. We ooh and ahh over&nbsp;the icing artfully laid on its top. We smile as its buttery crumbs caress our tongues. It's a rare gift that not only tickles the fancy and teases the palate, but satisfies all the way to the heart. <br>&nbsp;<br>What?! You say I've got&nbsp;a soft spot for cookies? &nbsp;I won't deny it. It comes from years of cookie-decorating fun with my sibs under the supportive tutelage of my mom. Each Christmas we donned her frilly June Cleaver-esque aprons and tried our darnedest to outdo one another with the cleverest cookie design. Even when disfigured cutouts or errant icing blobs foiled our plans, we earned Mom's&nbsp;unswerving praise -- and, better yet, the excuse to eat our mistakes.<br><br>Warm and fuzzy memories aside, cookies are practical and infinitely adaptable, too. Dough can be made ahead, frozen, and then cut and baked when you've got the spare time. Cookies can be top-coated, flocked, stenciled, marbled, rubber-stamped, stacked, and arranged into countless 3-D designs. &nbsp;And once baked and decorated, cookies have the advantage of a relatively long shelf life.

Since then, Sylvia Nasar's celebrated biography <i>A Beautiful Mind</i>, the basis of a new major motion picture, has revealed the man. <i>The Essential John Nash</i> reveals his work--in his own words. This book presents, for the first time, the full range of Nash's diverse contributions not only to game theory, for which he received the Nobel, but to pure mathematics--from Riemannian geometry and partial differential equations--in which he commands even greater acclaim among academics. Included are nine of Nash's most influential papers, most of them written over the decade beginning in 1949.</p><br><p> From 1959 until his astonishing remission three decades later, the man behind the concepts "Nash equilibrium" and "Nash bargaining"--concepts that today pervade not only economics but nuclear strategy and contract talks in major league sports--had lived in the shadow of a condition diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenia. In the introduction to this book, Nasar recounts how Nash had, by the age of thirty, gone from being a wunderkind at Princeton and a rising mathematical star at MIT to the depths of mental illness.</p><br><p> In his preface, Harold Kuhn offers personal insights on his longtime friend and colleague; and in introductions to several of Nash's papers, he provides scholarly context. In an afterword, Nash describes his current work, and he discusses an error in one of his papers. A photo essay chronicles Nash's career from his student days in Princeton to the present. Also included are Nash's Nobel citation and autobiography.</p><br><br><p> <i>The Essential John Nash</i> makes it plain why one of Nash's colleagues termed his style of intellectual inquiry as "like lightning striking." All those inspired by Nash's dazzling ideas will welcome this unprecedented opportunity to trace these ideas back to the exceptional mind they came from.</p></p><p><p>"John Nash's creative work in game theory has of course had the most profound influence on both its mathematics and its practical applications in economics. It is very good to see his work in this area joined with his other mathematical contributions in a single volume, to give a more rounded perspective."<b>--Kenneth J. Arrow, 1972 Nobel Laureate in Economics</b></p><p>"These papers are among the most important original contributions to mathematics of the twentieth century. They have been extremely influential and their influence continues to grow."<b>--Joseph J. Kohn, Princeton University</b></p><p>"John Nash has attracted enormous popular interest over the past few years. In many ways, the notion of equilibrium in game theory that bears his name is the central concept in game theory, which has led to a revolution in the field of economics. This book, by bringing together Nash's work in game theory and in mathematics, will allow readers to appreciate the scope of his work."<b>--David M. Kreps, Stanford Business School</b></p><b>Harold W. Kuhn</b> is Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at Princeton University. Winner of the 1980 von Neumann Prize in Theory, he is the editor of several books (all Princeton), including <i>Classics in Game Theory, Linear Inequalities and Related Systems, Contributions to the Theory of Games, I and II</i>, and is the author of <i>Lectures on the Theory of Games</i> (forthcoming, Princeton). <b>Sylvia Nasar</b> tells the story of Nash's life in <i>A Beautiful Mind</i> (Simon &amp; Schuster), which won the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1999 and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.

As a boy, he yearned for an electric train. To his delight, on Christmas morning he got exactly that a train that operated through the miracle of electricity. Then he noticed a second train that his mother had purchased for the boy down the street whose family was struggling. Although it was only a wind-up train, it had an beautiful oil tanker car, which little Tommy wanted for his own. Soon after, Tommy s mother invited him to accompany her to the neighbor s home to deliver the gift. Young Mark was thrilled with his new train and, of course, didn t notice the missing train car. However, a remorseful Tommy did. What happened next will bring the spirit of Christmas into every heart and home. Illustrated by renowned artist Dan Burr, The Christmas Train is sure to be a classic Christmas story and a beautiful addition to every Christmas library. The Christmas Train won the Mom&#39;s Choice Award in 2012.</p><p>Thomas S. Monson has served as the 16th President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints since 2008. He served in the United States Navy near the close of World War II. He and his wife, Frances, are the parents of three children, and have eight grandchildren and seven greatgrandchildren.</p><h2>When the Mississippi Ran Backwards: Empire, Intrigue, Murder, and the New Madrid Earthquakes</h2><p>An account of the ecological and historical impact of a series of Mississippi River Valley earthquakes that took place in 1811 and 1812 documents how towns were destroyed, a massive lake was created, and political loyalties were altered, changing the course of the War of 1812. 35,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Jay Feldman's</b> writings have appeared in <i>Smithsonian</i> magazine, <i>Newsweek, Sports Illustrated, The New York Times, Gourmet, Whole Earth Review,</i> and a wide variety of other national, regional, and local publications. A number of his pieces have been anthologized. He has also written for television, film, and the stage. He lives in Davis, California. For more information, visit www.jfeldman.com.The shocks that devastated the Mississippi River town of New Madrid, Mo., and environs in the winter of 1812 were among the strongest earthquakes in America's history. But in human terms they were fairly inconsequential (about 100 people died in the lightly populated area), hence the resort to empire, intrigue and murder to flesh out this engaging if haphazard survey of the Mississippi valley frontier. Journalist and scriptwriter Feldman gives a lucid rundown of the geology and seismology of the quakes and skillfully deploys sparse firsthand memoirs of the disaster to describe the titanic upheavals of earth and water that terrified onlookers. But that leaves most of the book still to write, so he brings in other developments tenuously related to the earthquake and the region. These include the brutal Indian wars of the early 19th century, the maiden voyage of the Mississippi's first steamboat and the murder of a Kentucky slave by his degenerate owner, which came to light after one of the titular quakes demolished the chimney where the victim's remains were hidden; a set piece of the Battle of New Orleans is tacked on as a coda. The author's attempts to tie these happenings together are perfunctory at best, but it's a diverting patchwork of events, with colorful characters, that Feldman's well-paced storytelling turns into a vivid historical panorama. <i>Agent, Alex Smithline.

Now he brings his knowledge, his firsthand experience and his intimate understanding of the Middle East to a book that addresses the full complexity of its political history and its current state of affairs.<br><br>Passionate in his concerns about the region and relentless in his pursuit of the truth, Fisk has been able to enter the world of the Middle East and the lives of its people as few other journalists have. The result is a work of stunning reportage. His unblinking eyewitness testimony to the horrors of war places him squarely in the tradition of the great frontline reporters of the Second World War. His searing descriptions of lives mangled in the chaos of battle and of the battles themselves are at once dreadful and heartrending. <br><br>This is also a book of lucid, incisive analysis. Reaching back into the long history of invasion, occupation and colonization in the region, Fisk sets forth this information in a way that makes clear how a history of injustice &#x201c;has condemned the Middle East to war.&#x201d; He lays open the role of the West in the seemingly endless strife and warfare in the region, traces the growth of the West&#x2019;s involvement and influence there over the past one hundred years, and outlines the West&#x2019;s record of support for some of the most ruthless leaders in the Middle East. He chronicles the ever-more-powerful military presence of the United States and tracks the consequent, increasingly virulent anti-Western&#x2013;and particularly anti-American&#x2013;sentiment among the region&#x2019;s Muslim populations. <br><br>Fisk interweaves this history with his own vividly rendered experiences in Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Algeria, Israel, Palestine and Lebanon&#x2013;on the front lines; behind the scenes; in the streets of cities and villages; and inside military headquarters, the hideouts of guerrillas, the homes of ordinary citizens. Here, too, are indelible portraits of Osama bin Laden, Ayatollah Khomeini and Yassir Arafat, among others&#x2013;all of whom he has met face-to-face&#x2013;revelatory in their apprehension of the individuals and the ideologies they represent.<br><br>Finally, <i>The Great War for Civilisation</i> is the story of journalists in war: of their attempts to report the first, impartial drafts of history, to monitor the centers of power, to challenge authority (&#x201c;especially . . . when governments and politicians take us to war&#x201d;) and to battle an increasingly partisan worldwide media in their determination to report the truth. <br><br>Unflinching, provocative, brilliantly written&#x2013;a work of major importance for today&#x2019;s world.</p><p>Best-selling author and journalist Robert Fisk, based in Beirut as Middle East Correspondent of <i>The Independent</i>, has lived in the Middle East for almost three decades and holds more British and international journalism awards than any other foreign correspondent. His last book, <i>Pity the Nation</i>, a history of the Lebanon war, was published to great critical acclaim.<b>CHAPTER ONE</b><br><br><b>&#x201c;One of Our Brothers Had a Dream . . . &#x201d;</b><br>"They combine a mad love of country with an equally mad indifference to life, their own as well as others. They are cunning, unscrupulous, and inspired."&#x2014;&#x201c;Stephen Fisher&#x201d; in Alfred Hitchcock&#x2019;s <i>Foreign Correspondent</i> (1940)<br><br>I knew it would be like this. On 19 March 1997, outside the Spinghar Hotel in Jalalabad with its manicured lawns and pink roses, an Afghan holding a Kalashnikov rifle invited me to travel in a car out of town. The highway to Kabul that evening was no longer a road but a mass of rocks and crevasses above the roaring waters of a great river. A vast mountain chain towered above us. The Afghan smiled at me occasionally but did not talk. I knew what his smile was supposed to say. Trust me. But I didn&#x2019;t. I smiled back the rictus of false friendship. Unless I saw a man I recognised&#x2014;an Arab rather than an Afghan&#x2014;I would watch this road for traps, checkpoints, gunmen who were there to no apparent purpose. Even inside the car, I could hear the river as it sloshed through gulleys and across wide shoals of grey stones and poured over the edge of cliffs. Trust Me steered the car carefully around the boulders and I admired the way his bare left foot eased the clutch of the vehicle up and down as a man might gently urge a horse to clamber over a rock.<br><br>A benevolent white dust covered the windscreen, and when the wipers cleared it the desolation took on a hard, unforgiving, dun-coloured uniformity. The track must have looked like this, I thought to myself, when Major-General William Elphinstone led his British army to disaster more than 150 years ago. The Afghans had annihilated one of the greatest armies of the British empire on this very stretch of road, and high above me were villages where old men still remembered the stories of great-grandfathers who had seen the English die in their thousands. The stones of Gandamak, they claim, were made black by the blood of the English dead. The year 1842 marked one of the greatest defeats of British arms. No wonder we preferred to forget the First Afghan War. But Afghans don&#x2019;t forget. &#x201c;<i>Farangiano</i>,&#x201d; the driver shouted and pointed down into the gorge and grinned at me. &#x201c;Foreigners.&#x201d; &#x201c;<i>Angrezi</i>.&#x201d; &#x201c;English.&#x201d; &#x201c;<i>Jang</i>.&#x201d; &#x201c;War.&#x201d; Yes, I got the point. &#x201c;<i>Irlanda</i>,&#x201d; I replied in Arabic. &#x201c;<i>Ana min Irlanda</i>.&#x201d; I am from Ireland. Even if he understood me, it was a lie. Educated in Ireland I was, but in my pocket was a small black British passport in which His Majesty&#x2019;s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs required in the name of Her Majesty that I should be allowed &#x201c;to pass freely without let or hindrance&#x201d; on this perilous journey. A teenage Taliban had looked at my passport at Jalalabad airport two days earlier, a boy soldier of maybe fourteen who held the document upside down, stared at it and clucked his tongue and shook his head in disapproval.<br><br>It had grown dark and we were climbing, overtaking trucks and rows of camels, the beasts turning their heads towards our lights in the gloom. We careered past them and I could see the condensation of their breath floating over the road. Their huge feet were picking out the rocks with infinite care and their eyes, when they caught the light, looked like dolls&#x2019; eyes. Two hours later, we stopped on a stony hillside and, after a few minutes, a pick-up truck came bouncing down the rough shale of the mountain.<br><br>An Arab in Afghan clothes came towards the car. I recognised him at once from our last meeting in a ruined village. &#x201c;I am sorry, Mr. Robert, but I must give you the first search,&#x201d; he said, prowling through my camera bag and newspapers. And so we set off up the track that Osama bin Laden built during his jihad against the Russian army in the early 1980s, a terrifying, slithering, two-hour odyssey along fearful ravines in rain and sleet, the windscreen misting as we climbed the cold mountain. &#x201c;When you believe in jihad, it is easy,&#x201d; he said, fighting with the steering wheel as stones scuttered from the tyres, tumbling down the precipice into the clouds below. From time to time, lights winked at us from far away in the darkness. &#x201c;Our brothers are letting us know they see us,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>After an hour, two armed Arabs&#x2014;one with his face covered in a kuffiah scarf, eyes peering at us through spectacles, holding an anti-tank rocket-launcher over his right shoulder&#x2014;came screaming from behind two rocks. &#x201c;Stop! Stop!&#x201d; As the brakes were jammed on, I almost hit my head on the windscreen. &#x201c;Sorry, sorry,&#x201d; the bespectacled man said, putting down his rocket-launcher. He pulled a metal detector from the pocket of his combat jacket, the red light flicking over my body in another search. The road grew worse as we continued, the jeep skidding backwards towards sheer cliffs, the headlights playing across the chasms on either side. &#x201c;Toyota is good for jihad,&#x201d; my driver said. I could only agree, noting that this was one advertising logo the Toyota company would probably forgo.<br><br>There was moonlight now and I could see clouds both below us in the ravines and above us, curling round mountaintops, our headlights shining on frozen waterfalls and ice-covered pools. Osama bin Laden knew how to build his wartime roads; many an ammunition truck and tank had ground its way up here during the titanic struggle against the Russian army. Now the man who led those guerrillas&#x2014;the first Arab fighter in the battle against Moscow&#x2014;was back again in the mountains he knew. There were more Arab checkpoints, more shrieked orders to halt. One very tall man in combat uniform and wearing shades carefully patted my shoulders, body, legs and looked into my face. <i>Salaam aleikum</i>, I said. Peace be upon you. Every Arab I had ever met replied <i>Aleikum salaam</i> to this greeting. But not this one. There was something cold about this man. Osama bin Laden had invited me to meet him in Afghanistan, but this was a warrior without the minimum courtesy. He was a machine, checking out another machine.<br><br>It had not always been this way. Indeed, the first time I met Osama bin Laden, the way could not have been easier. Back in December 1993, I had been covering an Islamic summit in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum when a Saudi journalist friend of mine, Jamal Kashoggi, walked up to me in the lobby of my hotel. Kashoggi, a tall, slightly portly man in a long white <i>dishdash</i> robe, led me by the shoulder outside the hotel. &#x201c;There is someone I think you should meet,&#x201d; he said. Kashoggi is a sincere believer&#x2014;woe betide anyone who regards his round spectacles and roguish sense of humour as a sign of spiritual laxity&#x2014;and I guessed at once to whom he was referring. Kashoggi had visited bin Laden in Afghanistan during his war against the Russian army. &#x201c;He has never met a Western reporter before,&#x201d; he announced. &#x201c;This will be interesting.&#x201d; Kashoggi was indulging in a little applied psychology. He wanted to know how bin Laden would respond to an infidel. So did I.<br><br>Bin Laden&#x2019;s story was as instructive as it was epic. When the Soviet army invaded Afghanistan in 1979, the Saudi royal family&#x2014;encouraged by the CIA&#x2014;sought to provide the Afghans with an Arab legion, preferably led by a Saudi prince, who would lead a guerrilla force against the Russians. Not only would he disprove the popularly held and all too accurate belief that the Saudi leadership was effete and corrupt, he could re-establish the honourable tradition of the Gulf Arab warrior, heedless of his own life in defending the <i>umma</i>, the community of Islam. True to form, the Saudi princes declined this noble mission. Bin Laden, infuriated at both their cowardice and the humiliation of the Afghan Muslims at the hands of the Soviets, took their place and, with money and machinery from his own construction company, set off on his own personal jihad.<br><br>A billionaire businessman and himself a Saudi, albeit of humbler Yemeni descent, in the coming years he would be idolised by both Saudis and millions of other Arabs, the stuff of Arab schoolboy legend from the Gulf to the Mediterranean. Not since the British glorified Lawrence of Arabia had an adventurer been portrayed in so heroic, so influential a role. Egyptians, Saudis, Yemenis, Kuwaitis, Algerians, Syrians and Palestinians made their way to the Pakistani border city of Peshawar to fight alongside bin Laden. But when the Afghan mujahedin guerrillas and bin Laden&#x2019;s Arab legion had driven the Soviets from Afghanistan, the Afghans turned upon each other with wolflike and tribal venom. Sickened by this perversion of Islam&#x2014;original dissension within the <i>umma</i> led to the division of Sunni and Shia Muslims&#x2014;bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia.<br><br>But his journey of spiritual bitterness was not over. When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, bin Laden once more offered his services to the Saudi royal family. They did not need to invite the United States to protect the place of the two holiest shrines of Islam, he argued. Mecca and Medina, the cities in which the Prophet Mohamed received and recited God&#x2019;s message, should be defended only by Muslims. Bin Laden would lead his &#x201c;Afghans,&#x201d; his Arab mujahedin, against the Iraqi army inside Kuwait and drive them from the emirate. King Fahd of Saudi Arabia preferred to put his trust in the Americans. So as the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division arrived in the north-eastern Saudi city of Dhahran and deployed in the desert roughly 500 miles from the city of Medina&#x2014;the place of the Prophet&#x2019;s refuge and of the first Islamic society&#x2014;bin Laden abandoned the corruption of the House of Saud to bestow his generosity on another &#x201c;Islamic Republic&#x201d;: Sudan.<br><br>Our journey north from Khartoum lay though a landscape of white desert and ancient, unexplored pyramids, dark, squat Pharaonic tombs smaller than those of Cheops, Chephren and Mycerinus at Giza. Though it was December, a sharp, superheated breeze moved across the desert, and when Kashoggi tired of the air conditioning and opened his window, it snapped at his Arab headdress. &#x201c;The people like bin Laden here,&#x201d; he said, in much the way that one might comment approvingly of a dinner host. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s got his business here and his construction company and the government likes him. He helps the poor.&#x201d; I could understand all this. The Prophet Mohamed, orphaned at an early age, had been obsessed by the poor in seventh-century Arabia, and generosity to those who lived in poverty was one of the most attractive characteristics of Islam. Bin Laden&#x2019;s progress from &#x201c;holy&#x201d; warrior to public benefactor might allow him to walk in the Prophet&#x2019;s footsteps. He had just completed building a new road from the Khartoum&#x2013;Port Sudan highway to the tiny desert village of Almatig in northern Sudan, using the same bulldozers he had employed to construct the guerrilla trails of Afghanistan; many of his labourers were the same fighters who had been his comrades in the battle against the Soviet Union. The U.S. State Department took a predictably less charitable view of bin Laden&#x2019;s beneficence. It accused Sudan of being a &#x201c;sponsor of international terrorism&#x201d; and bin Laden himself of operating &#x201c;terrorist training camps&#x201d; in the Sudanese desert.<br><br>But when Kashoggi and I arrived in Almatig, there was Osama bin Laden in his gold-fringed robe, sitting beneath the canopy of a tent before a crowd of admiring villagers and guarded by the loyal Arab mujahedin who fought alongside him in Afghanistan. Bearded, silent figures&#x2014;unarmed, but never more than a few yards from the man who recruited them, trained them and then dispatched them to destroy the Soviet army&#x2014;they watched unsmiling as the Sudanese villagers lined up to thank the Saudi businessman who was about to complete the road linking their slums to Khartoum for the first time in history.<br><br>My first impression was of a shy man. With his high cheekbones, narrow eyes and long brown robe, he would avert his eyes when the village leaders addressed him. He seemed ill-at-ease with gratitude, incapable of responding with a full smile when children in miniature chadors danced in front of him and preachers admired his wisdom. &#x201c;We have been waiting for this road through all the revolutions in Sudan,&#x201d; a bearded sheikh announced. &#x201c;We waited until we had given up on everybody&#x2014;and then Osama bin Laden came along.&#x201d; I noticed how bin Laden, head still bowed, peered up at the old man, acknowledging his age but unhappy that he should be sitting at ease in front of him, a young man relaxing before his elders. He was even more unhappy at the sight of a Westerner standing a few feet away from him, and from time to time he would turn his head to look at me, not with malevolence but with grave suspicion.<br><br>Kashoggi put his arms around him. Bin Laden kissed him on both cheeks, one Muslim to another, both acknowledging the common danger they had endured together in Afghanistan. Jamal Kashoggi must have brought the foreigner for a reason. That is what bin Laden was thinking. For as Kashoggi spoke, bin Laden looked over his shoulder at me, occasionally nodding. &#x201c;Robert, I want to introduce you to Sheikh Osama,&#x201d; Kashoggi half-shouted through children&#x2019;s songs. Bin Laden was a tall man and he realised that this was an advantage when he shook hands with the English reporter. <i>Salaam aleikum</i>. His hands were firm, not strong, but, yes, he looked like a mountain man. The eyes searched your face. He was lean and had long fingers and a smile which&#x2014;while it could never be described as kind&#x2014;did not suggest villainy. He said we might talk, at the back of the tent where we could avoid the shouting of the children.<br><br>Looking back now, knowing what we know, understanding the monstrous beast-figure he would become in the collective imagination of the world, I search for some clue, the tiniest piece of evidence, that this man could inspire an act that would change the world for ever&#x2014;or, more to the point, allow an American president to persuade his people that the world was changed for ever. Certainly his formal denial of &#x201c;terrorism&#x201d; gave no hint. The Egyptian press was claiming that bin Laden had brought hundreds of his Arab fighters with him to Sudan, while the Western embassy circuit in Khartoum was suggesting that some of the Arab &#x201c;Afghans&#x201d; whom this Saudi entrepreneur had flown to Sudan were now busy training for further jihad wars in Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt. Bin Laden was well aware of this. &#x201c;The rubbish of the media and embassies,&#x201d; he called it. &#x201c;I am a construction engineer and an agriculturalist. If I had training camps here in Sudan, I couldn&#x2019;t possibly do this job.&#x201d;</p><h2>Creative Cloth Doll Faces: Using Paints, Pastels, Fibers, Beading, Collage, and Sculpting Techniques</h2><p>The face is the most important feature of a doll -- it is also the most challenging.

What was the food on their table? Where did it come from? How did they get it? All these questions are addressed in Weaver's elegant prose.<p> But there's another side to the story, and Weaver meets his reader there, too: Where is food headed, and what's an individual to do? </p><p> We have seen the rise of hybrid crops in the years since World War II. They are good for the seed business because the grower can't just let a few plants grow to seed, save the seed, then plant that seed next season. Hybridized plants don't yield seed that's true to the character of the plant, so the grower has to return to the seed rack year after year. Buying seed on a commercial level is a big deal, as is growing enough of it to meet the market. A lot of tillable land in South America isn't growing food for hungry South Americans, but growing corn seed for American farmers, and the biggest use of corn in this country is animal feed. Not many hungry South Americans get to eat corn-fed American beef and pork. In one sense, he who controls seed controls food. Or, he who owns seed owns food, and the highest bidder takes all. </p><p> Heirloom seed, then, is more than a trinket or curiosity from the past. It represents the chance of survival in the future. Should an as-yet-unknown plant virus come along and take out the American hybrid corn crop (something that has in fact come close to happening), it's the genetic diversity available in heirloom, open-pollinated seeds that will save the bacon. Governments maintain plant gene banks, but individuals can do much the same, and authors like Weaver show how.</p><p> What Weaver injects into the tale is the incredible pleasure that comes of growing heirloom crops and saving seed, and of eating from a table laden with 17th- and 18th-century foods. He shares his own history and his family's history, all of it tied up in gardening and sharing and caring. This lovely book is an extension that can reach into any garden being dug today. In other words, don't hesitate with this title, whether history, science, gardening, or a rich enthusiasm for constructive ways the individual can affect the future drives your interest. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p>William Woys Weaver is a food historian and organic gardener known for his Roughwood Seed Collection in Devon, Pennsylvania. His six previous books include Pennsylvania Dutch Country Cooking, The Christmas Cook, and America Eats.</p><h2>Love, Loss, and What I Wore</h2><p>Ilene "Gingy" Beckerman's beloved and bestselling book has been adapted for the stage by Nora and Delia Ephron.

Because this is a "Harry Potterless" year, kids in need of a fix may find it in these two volumes. The conceit is that these are Harry's schoolbooks (<i>Fantastic </i> Beasts, by Newt Scamander; <i>Quidditch,</i> by Kennilworthy Whisp), with margin notes by Harry and pal Ron Weasley. The concept breaks down in the introductions: Professor Dumbledore explains that the books are being offered to muggles (because the proceeds of the books are going to British charity Comic Relief, a disclosure that will raise the eyebrows of any reader who undestands the importance of secrecy in the wizard world. Nevertheless, a lot of effort has gone into making these seem like real textbooks. The jackets look torn and faded, the print is (annoyingly) small, and the information is well detailed. Illustrations are in short supply, and not every fan will want to know this much about Quidditch and imaginary beasts, especially when the text is so hard to read. Buy several copies (the money really does go to charity), but expect a few disappointed readers. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

A highly readable drama filled with the blend of fact and fiction that is Michener&#39;s trademark.((Random House--Fiction-Historical)</p><p><b>James A. Michener</b> was one of the world&#x2019;s most popular writers, the author of more than forty books of fiction and nonfiction, including the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning <i>Tales of the South Pacific, </i>the bestselling novels <i>The Source, Hawaii, Alaska, Chesapeake, Centennial, Texas, Caribbean, </i>and <i>Caravans, </i>and the memoir <i>The World Is My Home</i>. Michener served on the advisory council to NASA and the International Broadcast Board, which oversees the Voice of America. Among dozens of awards and honors, he received America&#x2019;s highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 1977, and an award from the President&#x2019;s Committee on the Arts and Humanities in 1983 for his commitment to art in America. Michener died in 1997 at the age of ninety.In straightforward, unadorned prose, Michener spins an old-fashioned historical adventure as he follows a British expedition's doomed trek across Canada to the Klondike gold fields in 1897-1899. The group's leader, Lord Evelyn Luton, is an arrogant ass whose colossal stubbornness costs the lives of three of the five men. Totally dissimilar is the party's poet, frail, sensitive Trevor Blythe. Accompanying the four well-bred Englishmen on the journey is a shrewd Irish poacher who acts as the "servant." Besides exploring class tensions, Michener offers insight into how the British viewed their two former colonies--America and Canada--at the turn of the century. But basically this is an absorbing little tale of hubris, courage and redemption (Lutton, humbled by the tragedy, goes on to help Lloyd George rearm England just before WW I), as the dazed adventurers meet Canadian hucksters and friendly Indians, and cope with frozen rivers, mosquitoes, scurvy, dwindling food. In an afterword, Michener explains the germination of this saga, expanded from a section cut from his much longer novel Alaska. Maps.

Writer Carey is as irreverent as they come, but he also knows his theology inside and out, both Judeo-Christian and otherwise: King Solomon turns up, appropriately enough, in a hard-boiled detective role, and a few of the Norse gods put in memorable cameo appearances near the end of this volume. Lucifer himself is portrayed as a dapper man-about-town who can rip people's faces off when necessary. However, <i>Inferno </i>doesn't quite hold together as a book, since it collects three separate story lines, two of which are greatly indebted to other volumes in the series, and each drawn by different artists. (The third, "Bearing Gifts," is a short, stand-alone fable in which Lucifer doesn't actually appear, featuring the best art of the volume: squiggly, wobbly work by Dean Ormston that nicely gets across its sense of the uncanny.) "Inferno" itself is a mess of a story that picks up partway through with a cleverly metaphysical duel between representatives of Hell and Heaven, neither of whom are playing entirely according to the rules of their own side. "Come to Judgment," a cynical parable about the difference between justice and vengeance, features a witty twist on some fairy-tale conventions. The book has more than a few memorable moments, but new readers may be mystified. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Leaving her twin toddlers at home in the Cotswolds with her husband, an American lawyer working in England, Lori sets off for Wyrdhurst Hall to evaluate a private library for a wealthy client who has given the castle to his niece Nicole and her new husband, Jared Hollander. But a mysteriously open gate leads Lori dangerously astray. Rescued from a potentially fatal accident by a handsome and charming stranger to whom she is immediately attracted, she resumes her journey to the gloomy Scottish estate. Once ensconced at Wyrdhurst, Lori finds the young mistress is terrified by the sounds and apparitions that haunt the castle and equally frightened of her cold and controlling husband. Lori uncovers a secret cache of letters from an earlier era that hint at a tragic love affair and a death that must be avenged before Wyrdhurst's ghost--and its present inhabitants--can rest in peace. With Aunt Dimity's magic journal warning her that danger surrounds her passionate infatuation with Adam Chase, who has his own reasons for wanting Lori to get to the bottom of the mystery, our intrepid heroine traces the ghostly apparitions to their source. In the process she makes the acquaintance of the restless spirit whose love for a World War I soldier was thwarted, but not destroyed, by Wyrdhurst's original owner and provides the happy-ever-after ending to this charming and lively mystery.

After almost two years of hard training, they parachuted into Normandy on DDay and, later, Operation Market Garden. They fought their way through Belgium, France, and Germany, survived overwhelming odds, liberated concentration camps, and drank a victory toast in April 1945 at Hitler's hideout in the Alps. Here, revealed for the first time, are stories of war, sacrifice, and courage as experienced by one of the most revered combat units in military history. In <i>We Who Are Alive and Remain</i>, twenty men who were there and are alive today-and the families of three deceased others-recount the horrors and the victories, the bonds they made, the tears and blood they shed...and the brothers they lost.</p><p>xAnyone hooked on Stephen Ambrose&#39;s HBO series, &#34;Band of Brothers,&#34; won&#39;t want to miss these stories from the 506th Parachute Infantry. The author interviewed 20 surviving members of Easy Company, and their remembrances of WWII combine in an audio collage of the men&#39;s backgrounds, training, transport, combat, homecoming, and lives after the war. George Wilson distinguishes the men with varying accents, tone, and pacing. He melds their individual stories into a blend that flows easily, with each voice and description contributing to an authentic picture of what the war felt like to the men who fought it. For the most part, the men record their memories without emotion, but Wilson conveys the tension, loss, and camaraderie on and off the battlefield.

A select, and utterly obsessed, few compete in one of the world?s quirkiest contests -- the race to spot the most species in North America in a single year. And 1998 wasn?t just a big year. It was the biggest. <b>The Big Year </b>is Pulitzer Prize-winner Mark Obmascik?s account of what was to become the greatest birding year of all time.<br><br>It was freak weather conditions that ensured all previous records were broken, but what becomes clear within the pages of this classic portrait of obsession is that while our feathered friends may be the objective of the Big Year competition, it?s the curious activities and behavioural patterns of the pursuing ?homo sapiens? that are the real cause for concern. It is a contest that reveals much of the human character in extremes. Such are the author?s powers of observation that he brilliantly brings to life and gets under the skin of these extraordinary, eccentric and obsessive birders while empathizing with and eventually succumbing to the all-consuming nature of their obsession. The result is a wonderfully funny, acutely observed classic to rank alongside the best of Bill Bryson.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i><b>Mark Obmascik</b> has been a journalist for two decades, most recently at the <i>Denver Post,</i> where he was lead writer for the newspaper's Pulitzer Prize in 2000 and winner of the 2003 National Press Club Award for environmental journalism.

In the summer of 1945, soon after the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany, Thomas J. Dodd, the father of U.S. Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, traveled to the devastated city of Nuremberg to serve as a staff lawyer in this unprecedented trial for crimes against humanity. Thanks to his agile legal mind and especially to his skills at interrogating the defendants&#x2014;including such notorious figures as Hermann G�ring, Alfred Rosenberg, Albert Speer, Joachim von Ribbentrop, and Rudolf Hess&#x2014;he quickly rose to become the number two prosecutor in the U.S. contingent.<br><br>Over the course of fifteen months, Dodd described his efforts and his impressions of the proceedings in nightly letters to his wife, Grace. The letters remained in the Dodd family archives, unexamined, for decades. When Christopher Dodd, who followed his father&#x2019;s path to the Senate, sat down to read the letters, he was overwhelmed by their intimacy, by the love story they unveil, by their power to paint vivid portraits of the accused war criminals, and by their insights into the historical importance of the trials.<br><br>Along with Christopher Dodd&#x2019;s reflections on his father&#x2019;s life and career, and on the inspiration that good people across the world have long taken from the event that unfolded in the courtroom at Nuremberg, where justice proved to be stronger than the most unspeakable evil, these letters give us a fresh, personal, and often unique perspective on a true turning point in the history of our time. In today&#x2019;s world, with new global threats once again put-ting our ideals to the test, Letters from Nuremberg reminds us that fear and retribution are not the only bases for confrontation. As Christopher Dodd says here, &#x201c;Now, as in the era of Nuremberg, this nation should never tailor its eternal principles to the conflict of the moment, for if we do so, we will be shadowing those we seek to overcome.&#x201d;</p><p>CHRISTOPHER J. DODD, son of the late Senator Thomas J. Dodd, is a U.S. senator from Connecticut. He is chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee and a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Labor and Human Resources Committee. A former Peace Corps volunteer, Senator Dodd is a recipient of the Edmund S. Muskie Public Service Award and is also widely known for his work on children and family issues. He and his wife, Jackie Clegg Dodd, have two young daughters, Grace and Christina, and live in a converted schoolhouse in East Haddam, Connecticut.<br><br>LARY BLOOM, author of The Writer Within, Lary Bloom&#x2019;s Connecticut Notebook, and other books, is a columnist for the New York Times and Connecticut magazine. He is also a playwright, lyricist, and memoir teacher, and was the editor of the Sunday magazines of the Miami Herald and the Hartford Courant. He lives in Chester, Connecticut.

In all, there were fifteen of us, senior members of various committees, addressing difficult and timely issues during our monthly lunch meeting. In a few weeks, Americans would go to the polls and our party seemed to have a reasonable chance of regaining Congress for the first time in a dozen years. But no one seemed overconfident, and for good reason.<br><br>Room S-211 has a sense of seriousness and timelessness. It features marbleized walls, period window cornices, a chandelier installed during the Grant Administration, and the elaborate ceiling fresco of caryotid figures that it took the Italian artist Constantino Brumidi a decade (from 1857 to 1867) to complete. In that place of serious appointments, many heavy decisions have been made.<br><br>It is where LBJ, as Senate majority leader, twisted arms of fellow Democrats until they came around to his viewpoint. It is the venue where in 1959 Johnson promised my father, newly elected to the Senate, a seat on the Foreign Relations Committee. Forty-seven years later, in that historic room, I would try a little arm twisting of my own.<br><br>When Carl Levin&#x2019;s turn to speak came, we prepared for the inevitable. Carl, one of the most respected members of the Senate and the highest- ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, addressed our political bind. But there were certain facts he didn&#x2019;t need to review&#x2014; we knew them too well.<br><br>President George W. Bush was looking for a way around his legal roadblock. Before the Supreme Court ruling that summer in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, he had seized unprecedented war powers, deciding that the Administration alone had the authority to determine how to treat prisoners in the war on terror.<br><br>He rejected domestic law and international treaties on methods of interrogation&#x2014;a policy that led to allegations internationally that Americans endorse torture.<br><br>The president has maintained that the United States is in a state of war against terrorism, and therefore he has the authority to hold enemy combatants indefinitely without trial, formal charges, or revealment of evidence against them. For those detainees that he decided to try, he established military commissions. Appeals could not be made through the court system. There was no significant challenge to them until the case of Hamdan v. Rumsfeld reached the Supreme Court.<br><br>Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a native of Yemen, had been captured in Afghanistan in 2001 and then shipped to Guant�namo Bay, where he was held along with several hundred others. Hamdan was suspected of delivering weapons to Al Qaeda and charged with conspiracy to commit terrorism. Hamdan brought suit, arguing that the military commission formed to try him was illegal and that, as a defendant, he lacked the protections specified by the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Geneva conventions. The argument persuaded the lower court but not the federal court of appeals.<br><br>In its ruling, which by a 5&#x2013;3 vote overturned the appeals court, the Supreme Court said among other things that the president needed the approval of Congress to pursue measures other than those expressly dictated by existing U.S. laws and treaties. The president&#x2019;s quick response was to propose legislation that would have Congress rubber- stamp his initial practices&#x2014;reinstating the commissions as originally structured and redefining the Geneva conventions by weakening its protections. He demanded a free hand in interrogations&#x2014;a free hand, we knew from the examples of Abu Ghraib, Guant�namo, and secret prisons around the globe, that was deeply troubling.<br><br>As the fifth anniversary of September 11 approached, the country was once again reminded of the treachery that can come from any direction at any time. Since that dreadful day in 2001, many Republicans have tried to paint Democrats as weak on defense. Any objections to the Iraq policy were portrayed as cowardly or even treasonous.<br><br>In a speech to the Republican National Committee in January 2006, Karl Rove offered advice similar to what he delivered four years earlier in advance of the 2002 midterm elections: proclaim the Democrats weak on protecting America. Indeed, when Democrats pointed out, correctly, that National Security Agency warrentless wiretapping was illegal, Rove and his crowd twisted this fact for political advantage. The president was soon saying that Democrats were &#x201c;opposed to listening in on terrorists.&#x201d;<br><br>Sloganeering against the &#x201c;cut-and-run&#x201d; Democrats became a more reliable policy than any actual foreign policy. Starting the war in Iraq, as time proved, was a mistake, but the president stuck by his guns. I had been among those who voted to give him authorization, because at the time I believed the Administration&#x2019;s characterization of the intelligence that raised the specter that Saddam Hussein already possessed or was actively pursuing a deadly stockpile for imminent use. I hoped that with my vote, the Administration would be able to present a strong case to the UN to aggressively support the UN inspections of Iraq in order to fully determine whether Saddam Hussein was stockpiling weapons of mass destruction. The Administration chose not to do so but instead went to war in Iraq. It soon became clear that the intelligence&#x2014;hence, the primary reason to go to war&#x2014;was wrong. And as the war became a heavy burden on America&#x2014; drawing us, as it did, from a more sensible and effective strategy against worldwide terror&#x2014;I and others worked to find ways to end it.<br><br>The president, however, tried to turn the Supreme Court defeat in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld into an offensive maneuver. As he saw it, it was a chance to solidify the Republican stance on terror. Carl Levin and others concluded that the best we as Democrats could do&#x2014;with the elections so imminent&#x2014;was to support a new compromise measure. The senatorial trio of John McCain, John Warner, and Lindsey Graham, all of them experienced in military matters, seemed to favor a reasonable plan for treatment of prisoners and retain elements of habeas corpus&#x2014; a basic right that our justice system, and the international community of civilized countries, have held dear.<br><br>None of us thought the compromise suggested by the three senators was perfect, but the group as a whole seemed content to let the issue rest. This is the nature of politics: You push until you can push no further, and at the close of the Senate day, you are at least satisfied that you have helped steer the body from a ruinous course.<br><br>I had not, after all, parachuted into this fray. I had been involved in the fight for human rights ever since, as a freshman senator, I became a member of the Foreign Relations Committee in 1981. This was a natural extension of my father&#x2019;s legacy at Nuremberg and of his priorities in the U.S. Senate. It was a result, too, of my Peace Corps service in the 1960s, when, in the Dominican Republic, I saw firsthand the results of oppression and became committed to addressing such issues.<br><br>The big human rights debates of the early 1980s centered on Latin America, where I focused much of my work. I developed relationships with key figures in hot-spot countries&#x2014;Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua. The U.S. political landscape at the time was charged in a way similar to what would happen years later in relation to Iraq.<br><br>President Reagan reduced the many volatile political situations in Central America to what he saw as a worldwide Communist plot, making the region a major focus of his foreign policy. The Soviet Union funneled arms and other resources to certain parties, and in President Reagan&#x2019;s view, it was necessary to back those who stood against Communism, no matter their own records on human rights.<br><br>President Reagan, for example, wanted to send support to the government of El Salvador, led at the time by a civilian/military junta, which was fighting leftist guerillas. The government&#x2019;s notorious death squads also targeted those who opposed its power. The archbishop �scar Arnulfo Romero, three American nuns, and a lay worker &#x2014;all of whom supported economic and political reform&#x2014;were gunned down. This was in an era of high political crimes throughout the region, from Argentina, where in the &#x201c;Dirty War&#x201d; thousands of dissidents disappeared, to Chile and to small villages of Central America.<br><br>I had seen all of this from a quite different perspective from President Reagan. To him, Communism was the issue. In American politics, such broad stances continued to play well with a significant segment of the public. Phil Gramm, the senator from Texas, weighed in during the debate on Nicaragua and whether to aid the contras in their rebellion against the leftist Sandinista government. To paraphrase my former colleague, he would often say that Nicaragua is only ten days by tank from Texas.<br><br>My own investigations made it clear to me that the excesses of power transcend political labels. The rule of law, on which my father&#x2019;s stance was always firm, is the ultimate standard. Murder, in short, is still murder. The idea of simply sending unrestricted funding to anyone fighting Communism was, as Senator Edward M. Kennedy said, &#x201c;giving a blank check to death squads and despotism.&#x201d;<br><br>My view on Communist influence differed from that of my father&#x2019;s&#x2014;he had firmly believed in the domino theory, so prevalent in regard to Vietnam. But I recalled that in his later years he understood that there were ominous forces quite apart from anything supported by the Soviets.<br><br>In the case of El Salvador in the early 1980s, it was clear to me that the wisest stance for the United States was to send aid to that country&#x2019;s government only if certain conditions were met. And so, as a freshman senator, I introduced an amendm...</p><h2>And Here&#39;s the Kicker: Conversations With 21 Top Humor Writers on Their Craft</h2><p>DID YOU HEAR THE ONE ABOUT ?Every great joke has a punch line, and every great humor writer has an arsenal of experiences, anecdotes, and obsessions that were the inspiration for that humor. In fact, those who make a career out of entertaining strangers with words are a notoriously intelligent and quirky lot. And boy, do they have some stories.In this entertaining and inspirational book, you&#39;ll hear from 21 top humor writers as they discuss the comedy-writing process, their influences, their likes and dislikes, and their experiences in the industry. You&#39;ll also learn some less useful but equally amusing things, such as:How screenwriter Buck Henry came up with the famous &#34;plastics&#34; line for &#34;The Graduate.&#34;How many times the cops were called on co-writers Sacha Baron Cohen and Dan Mazer during the shooting of &#34;Borat.&#34;What David Sedaris thinks of his critics. What crea</p><p>Mike Sacks has written for such publications as <i>The Believer</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, <i>GQ</i>, <i>Maxim</i>, <i>McSweeney's</i>, <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>Premiere</i>, <i>Radar</i>, <i>Salon</i>, <i>Time</i>, <i>Time Out New York</i>, <i>Vanity Fair</i>, <i>Vice</i> and <i>Women's Health</i>. He has worked at <i>The Washington Post</i>, and is currently on the editorial staff of <i>Vanity Fair</i>.From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Jeff Nussbaum When Al Gore was vice president and saw on his schedule that he would have to speak at an event that required humor, he would announce, with mock solemnity, that it was time to assemble the humor cabinet. This proclamation might well have been delivered by shofar, given that in practice it served as a call for most of the Jews on the staff. Perhaps the circumstances of my birth did qualify me to write jokes, although I think the vice president was more taken with the fact that my dad's family had actually run a hotel in the Catskills -- the real, live Borscht Belt. Either way, I ended up writing jokes for the vice president and others. I've found myself in the awkward situation of telling a former senator that the word "feces" is funnier than any of the synonyms he's considering. Or that a roomful of male septuagenarians will get the punch line "If it lasts longer than four hours, consult a physician." But when asked why, I always wished I had a better answer than "Because it's funny." Someone, I thought, should assemble a compendium of insights and techniques from actual humor writers. That's exactly what Mike Sacks did in putting together "And Here's The Kicker." Even if you weren't looking for a comedy desk reference, it's worth picking up the book just to find out which "Deep Thought" Jack Handey is most proud of writing. But "And Here's the Kicker" qualifies as a book only because the interviews have been put on paper and bound between two covers. What the reader experiences is a series of interviews conducted by a sort of hybrid between James Lipton and Dick Cavett: The questions are so hyper-informed that they're fawning, but they're just loose enough to be funny. Sacks, a humor writer himself, begins each chapter with a short biography of the interview subject, followed by an edited transcript of their conversation. The last question in these interviews is often about advice the humorist might have for aspiring writers. Aspiring writers, I'm guessing, will find this advice pretty depressing, given that it runs the gamut from "There are already too many comedy writers" (Marshall Brickman, co-writer, "Annie Hall") to "When you're 'in the zone,' a joke will just land on you like a butterfly" (George Meyer, writer and executive producer, "The Simpsons") to "Take a few beatings in the hallways of your high school or go through some sort of childhood trauma" (Judd Apatow, writer, director, producer of 95 percent of the movies made in the past five years). Slightly more helpful, but probably still depressing for the aspiring writer, are the how-tos that can be found throughout: how to get an agent, how to get a humor piece published, how to get a job writing jokes for late-night television, how to get your piece published in the New Yorker, etc. Sacks, who is on the editorial staff of Vanity Fair, scored some great interviews, finding writers who could comment on -- and in many cases created -- virtually every comedic touchstone we reference today, including the Marx Brothers, "The Colbert Report," Woody Allen's movies, Mad magazine, "The Simpsons," "Saturday Night Live" and late-night talk shows. The real fun in this book comes less when the writers talk about their craft and more when they talk about their careers, experiences, disappointments and favorite jokes. That's when you feel like you've been ushered into an exclusive fraternity (and it really is a fraternity -- only two women are interviewed) and exposed to the admiration and competition inherent in any club. Irving Brecher, supreme gag-writer for the Marx Brothers, grumbles that today's young writers are overpaid and lazy. Merrill Markoe, who has written for David Letterman, "Newhart" and "Sex in the City," provides an extended and acerbic list of what isn't funny: "I hate anyone who is wise beyond their years. I don't mind precocious children if they come as a side order with W.C. Fields." We're also let in on some great comedic revelations, such as the news that the feces in the bag Sacha Baron Cohen presented to the dinner party guests in "Borat" were real and that the person on the set who provided them was acknowledged in the credits. Brickman tells us that in the original premise of Woody Allen's "Sleeper," the only remaining piece of the president wasn't his nose. You can guess the rest. When these writers share with us what didn't succeed, we realize that humor isn't easy, that comedy is a craft and that even the greats had to work hard at it. Perhaps the best description of humor comes from Dave Barry, who as a newspaper columnist is almost an outsider compared with the rest of these interview subjects: "A sense of humor is a measurement of the extent to which we realize that we are trapped in a world almost totally devoid of reason. Laughter is how we express the anxiety we feel at this knowledge." By that measure, we're living in funny times indeed. bookworld@washpost.com <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

Eisenhower and Richard Nixon had a political and private relationship that lasted nearly twenty years, a tie that survived hurtful slights, tense misunderstandings, and the distance between them in age and temperament. Yet the two men brought out the best and worst in each other, and their association had important consequences for their respective presidencies. <br><br>In Ike and Dick, Jeffrey Frank rediscovers these two compelling figures with the sensitivity of a novelist and the discipline of a historian. He offers a fresh view of the younger Nixon as a striving tactician, as well as the ever more perplexing person that he became. He portrays Eisenhower, the legendary soldier, as a cold, even vain man with a warm smile whose sound instincts about war and peace far outpaced his understanding of the changes occurring in his own country. <br><br>Eisenhower and Nixon shared striking characteristics: high intelligence, cunning, and an aversion to confrontation, especially with each other. Ike and Dick, informed by dozens of interviews and deep archival research, traces the path of their relationship in a dangerous world of recurring crises as Nixon&#x2019;s ambitions grew and Eisenhower was struck by a series of debilitating illnesses. And, as the 1968 election cycle approached and the war in Vietnam roiled the country, it shows why Eisenhower, mortally ill and despite his doubts, supported Nixon&#x2019;s final attempt to win the White House, a change influenced by a family matter: his grandson David&#x2019;s courtship of Nixon&#x2019;s daughter Julie&#x2014;teenagers in love who understood the political stakes of their union.</p><p>Jeffrey Frank<b> </b>was a senior editor at <i>The New Yorker</i> and the deputy editor of the <i>Washington Post</i>&#x2019;s Outlook section.

Six weeks later, Eisenhower was in Washington for a parade in his honor. Stores and offices were closed and signs said &#x201c;Welcome Home, Ike!&#x201d;&#x2014;the nickname he&#x2019;d been given by childhood friends, soldiers, and total strangers. A million citizens watched the olive drab motorcade make its way from National Airport to Capitol Hill, where the general spoke to a cheering joint session of Congress.<br> <br>In Manhattan on the following day, some four million people turned out to see Ike as his open car traveled through the city. They filled the sidewalks and peered from windows, fire escapes, and almost any perch that let one claim a fleeting glimpse. The motorcade&#x2014;twenty-one cars, including the newsreel brigade&#x2014;went from the airport across the Triborough Bridge and entered Central Park at East 96th Street. There it made its way through the park where Eisenhower was applauded by thirty thousand schoolchildren lined up along the side of the road; now and then, a supervising teacher, or a nun in a black habit would tell the kids to step back, to get out of the way.<br> <br>With music provided by the Army band, the parade reached 60th Street and headed down Fifth Avenue, where the crowds grew thicker, pushing against barricades to see the general, a smiling fifty-five-year-old just under six feet tall, who stood and waved, occasionally returning a salute when he spotted men in uniform, some of whom were on crutches or had empty sleeves. At 44th Street, the police department&#x2019;s band took over from the Army&#x2019;s, and then, at 23rd Street, the fire department band replaced the NYPD&#x2019;s. At Union Square, as the caravan turned east and then motored south along the East River Drive, Eisenhower was able briefly to relax. It was a hot day&#x2014;temperatures were already in the 90s&#x2014;and when the cars approached the Fulton Fish Market, the sour air started to fill with a mist of ticker tape and torn paper&#x2014;seventy-seven tons of it, by one account. Eisenhower again rose to his feet and raised his arms to make them look like stiff cornstalks.<br> <br>One of the spectators was a Navy man, Lieutenant Commander Richard Milhous Nixon, who in his last months in uniform had been assigned to negotiate contract terminations with defense suppliers and, since the first of the year, had been moving around&#x2014;from Baltimore to Philadelphia to New York, where he happened to be on this June day, on Church Street. He watched the parade from the vantage point of a high window, which gave him an excellent view as the procession moved along lower Broadway. &#x201c;Maybe I just think it was that way&#x2014;I was about thirty stories up&#x2014;but I have the picture that there he came, with his arms outstretched and his face up to the sky, and that even from where I was I could feel the impact of his personality,&#x201d; Nixon recalled on several occasions. &#x201c;I could just make him out through the snowstorm of confetti, sitting in the back of his open car, waving and looking up at the cheering thousands like me who filled every window of the towering buildings. His arms were raised high over his head in the gesture that soon became his trademark.&#x201d; A variation of this&#x2014;two arms aloft with two fingers held up in victory symbols&#x2014;would become a Nixon trademark, too.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>Years later, even after all that happened between them, even though Eisenhower frequently made his life miserable, Nixon still saw him as a large historical figure, distant and even unapproachable despite his startlingly friendly smile. When Nixon talked about him to crowds and reporters, his language could veer toward reverence; in moments of ecstatic campaigning, he might refer to him as a man singled out by destiny, the heroic figure of that victory parade. But as Nixon got to know Eisenhower, he came to see a different man: someone who could radiate kindness and bonhomie while acting with cold indifference and even casual cruelty; and someone comfortable with issues of war and peace but far less so when it came to the problems of his own country and the politics of Washington.<br> <br>On a personal level, Nixon&#x2019;s early relationship with Eisenhower, who was old enough to be his father, had a filial aspect, though one without much filial affection. He saw the president as someone who rarely appreciated his contributions and as someone used to rapid, absolute obedience. During his eight years as vice president, he often felt &#x201c;like a junior officer coming in to see the commanding General,&#x201d; and sometimes a junior officer who had to endure rebukes and snubs, some of them more imagined than real. The journalist and Nixon confidant Ralph de Toledano told a friend, &#x201c;There were times when I would find Nixon literally close to tears after a session at the White House during which Eisenhower humiliated Nixon.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nixon, though, was an attentive pupil. He observed Eisenhower&#x2019;s responses to international crises and domestic emergencies and saw the value of an orderly, hierarchical White House, the importance of gestures, and the virtues of patience. Some of these lessons would fade, but Nixon absorbed them with the steady focus of an A student, eager to play a larger role in the eyes of a superior who regarded him as a bright synthesizer rather than as a proponent of imaginative views. Eisenhower did not have a high regard for professional politicians, but he valued Nixon&#x2019;s logical mind and his expressions of loyalty; and after a time, he listened to his opinions on questions ranging from civilian control of space to civil rights. It was understood that Nixon, as a veteran Red hunter, helped to protect Eisenhower from the resentful Republican right; Eisenhower returned the favor by giving Nixon an increasingly useful veil of moderation. Neither man regarded this as a partnership; vice presidents since the time of John Adams traditionally filled a distinctly peripheral role. But by accident as well as design, their association, in and out of office, grew and that helped to shape the ideology, foreign policy, and domestic goals of the twentieth century.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>When Eisenhower ran for president in 1952, he was an elderly sixty-two; the war had worn him down&#x2014;years of heavy smoking, too much coffee, and nonstop stress. When he selected the thirty-nine-year-old Nixon as his running mate, he relied on his advisers, most of whom he didn&#x2019;t know well and who hadn&#x2019;t come up with many choices; in any case, he wasn&#x2019;t personally acquainted with the potential field. Apart from an occasional stateside visit, he&#x2019;d been away from America (in Panama as a young officer; in the Philippines as an aide to General Douglas MacArthur; in North Africa and Europe during the war) a lot more than he&#x2019;d been home. He had met Nixon only twice, and briefly&#x2014;at a Bohemian Grove summer retreat in the summer of 1950 and in Paris in the spring of 1951, when he was at SHAPE, the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe. He was aware of all the anti-Communist excitement in the States in which Nixon had played a significant part, but he never recorded an impression of Nixon himself.<br> <br>On the surface, the two men could not have been less alike. Nixon was a talented speaker, but he often seemed miserable in his political appearances; the journalist Russell Baker saw him as &#x201c;a painfully lonesome man undergoing an ordeal,&#x201d; and sympathized with &#x201c;his discomfort with the obligatory routines of his chosen profession.&#x201d; As a public man, he knew that he was unloved and sometimes spoke of the pain that cartoonists inflicted (&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not exactly amused to see myself pictured as a lowbrow moron,&#x201d; he said of the Herblock drawings that appeared with some regularity in the Washington Post). The aspect that so delighted caricaturists&#x2014;the close-set eyes, dark, heavy brows, what Garry Wills called his &#x201c;spatulate nose&#x201d;&#x2014;were all the more striking in contrast to those of Eisenhower, who had an expressive, mobile face (his skin turned dark red when he was angry) and that dazzling grin&#x2014;a spectacular display of surface warmth. Ike&#x2019;s appearance sometimes seemed to change as new thoughts occurred to him, which made him seem, as the military historian B. H. Liddell Hart observed, spontaneous and transparently honest.<br> <br>Despite that surface candor, though, Eisenhower was as private a man as Nixon, and sometimes an intimidating man. Many were struck by his eyes&#x2014;&#x201c;those cold blue laserlike eyes,&#x201d; an early campaign volunteer recalled. When he got angry, his longtime aide Bryce Harlow said, it was like &#x201c;looking into a Bessemer furnace.&#x201d; Those moments passed quickly; what was far more difficult was being subjected to his chilliness when, as Harlow put it, &#x201c;those blue eyes of his turned crystal cold.&#x201d; Nixon sometimes felt that unsettling chill, even when nothing was said. He came to realize that the president might refer to him in embracing terms&#x2014;&#x201c;We are very close.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am very happy that Dick Nixon is my friend&#x201d;&#x2014;just as he was aiming to be rid of him. And while Nixon acquired and kept a reputation for duplicity, Eisenhower was equally accomplished in the arts of deception and misdirection. He had no trouble ordering Nixon to undertake some of his nastiest chores, such as firing his top White House aide, and he tried to disassociate himself from Nixon&#x2019;s meanest campaign rhetoric, as if his vice president was speaking for someone else. As Nixon later put it in a much cited phrase&#x2014;language over which he carefully deliberated&#x2014;Eisenhower was &#x201c;a far more complex and devious man than most people realized.&#x201d; Nixon&#x2019;s vice presidential years were sometimes a struggle for survival. He was nearly forced off the ticket&#x2014;and into political oblivion&#x2014;in 1952, and Eisenhower wanted to jettison him four years later; both times, Nixon out-waited and outmaneuvered the general. When Nixon lost the presidency to John F. Kennedy in 1960, the most damaging&#x2014;and memorable&#x2014;words of the campaign were uttered by Eisenhower. Nixon thought that he knew who his enemies were&#x2014;Eisenhower&#x2019;s favorite brother, Milton, had little use for him; the president&#x2019;s press secretary, James Hagerty, could be distinctly unhelpful when Nixon most needed him, Eisenhower&#x2019;s close friend General Lucius Clay didn&#x2019;t trust him&#x2014;and sometimes he didn&#x2019;t know whether to number Eisenhower among them.<br> <br>Nixon was always alert to the trap that he&#x2019;d gotten himself into: doing what the party and the president expected of him could undermine his future, and it could be worse for him if he rebelled. It was a costly bargain. He was always on call to express the angry id of the party, but when he did so his opponents would resurrect a label he acquired in his 1950 Senate race: &#x201c;Tricky Dick.&#x201d; Because of this dilemma, Nixon often acted in a certain carefully controlled way; in his perfect, modulated responses, there was an aura of artifice&#x2014;not exactly calculating but as if he were measuring and judging each word, the &#x201c;tight-lipped, over-tense, and slightly perspiring manner of a desperately earnest man determined to make no slightest mistake, but not quite at home and not likely to be,&#x201d; in the words of William S. White. &#x201c;I was constantly aware of an inner man, one who was very private, very elusive,&#x201d; the Eisenhower adviser Gabriel Hauge wrote in an unpublished autobiography, and at the same time, the outward man was much like any striving employee&#x2014;exceptionally well prepared, taking careful notes, in a constant quest for commendation from a boss whose approval could always lift his uncertain spirits.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>Even in their worst moments, there was never a real breach; there was, rather, a fluctuating, unspoken level of discomfort. So it was a curious thing that their relationship, which was both political and personal, lasted and evolved as it did for nearly twenty years. Its duration alone was highly unusual. Presidents and vice presidents, whether Herbert Hoover and Charles Curtis (America&#x2019;s first and only Native American vice president) or Franklin Roosevelt and his three running mates, tended to have little or nothing to do with each other in or out of office. Eisenhower and Nixon had much to do with each other although Nixon was never in Ike&#x2019;s inner circle (his offices were across town, in the Capitol, where he could fulfill his only constitutional duty, as president of the Senate). During his presidency, though, Eisenhower tried to include Nixon in the decision-making machinery of the administration (Nixon kept count of the number of cabinet and National Security Council meetings over which he presided); he used him as a goodwill emissary, sending him to more than fifty countries over eight years while steadily increasing his responsibilities; and there was a barely perceptible shift in power as Eisenhower, limited by the Constitution to two terms and weakened by illness, saw Nixon&#x2019;s presidential goals become clearer and increasingly plausible.<br> <br>The two men were also drawn together at the end of Ike&#x2019;s life for personal reasons: in November 1967, over the general&#x2019;s objections, his grandson and namesake, Dwight David Eisenhower II, and Nixon&#x2019;s younger daughter, Julie, both of whom were born in 1948, announced their engagement; a year later, the Eisenhower and Nixon families were united by marriage. Yet even teenagers in love could become entangled in politics when the teenagers belonged to these two families. The relationship between David and Julie played a real part in Nixon&#x2019;s 1968 comeback campaign and it affected his relationship with Eisenhower, who, though he said that Nixon was ready for the presidency, seemed doubtful about his ability to win, and not entirely pleased by the prospect of actually having him in the White House.<br> 2<p></p> <br>In June of 1945, Dick Nixon was in many ways the model of the bright young postwar American professional out to improve his lot, a type recognizable to readers of novels by James Gould Cozzens or Sloan Wilson. He had been a lawyer in his hometown, Whittier, California (named after the Quaker poet John Greenleaf Whittier), and worked briefly in Washington, in the tire-rationing section of the Office of Price Administration. He got a Navy commission in August 1942, and served fourteen months in the South Pacific, in Bougainville; his last Navy assignment brought him to Middle River, Maryland. At thirty-two, he was older than most returning veterans, and he had no clear idea what was next for him, although he would likely return to the Whittier law practice that he&#x2019;d joined after graduating from Duke in 1937. He had responsibilities now. In June 1940, after an intense and single-minded courtship, he had married Thelma Catherine Ryan, known as Pat, an attractive young woman with dark red hair. Jessamyn West, a Nixon cousin and the author of the novel Friendly Persuasion, thought that Pat looked a little like Marlene Dietrich&#x2014;&#x201c;The same slanted, almost Slavic eyes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The same strong nose and clear jawline. The same long torso and fine legs.&#x201d;<br> <br>Although Nixon had finished near the top of his law school class (a classmate described him as &#x201c;a very studious individual&#x2014;a...</p><h2>The Great Oom: The Improbable Birth of Yoga in America</h2><p><b>The amazing story of how yoga came to America-and the charming rogue who made it possible </b><br><br> In Jazz Age New York, there was no place hotter than the Clarkstown Country Club, where celebrities such as Leopold Stokowski mingled with Vanderbilts, Goodriches, and Great War spies. They came for the club's circuses and burlesques but especially for the lectures on the subject at the heart of the club's mission: yoga. Their guru was the notorious Pierre Bernard, who trained with an Indian master and instructed his wealthy followers in the asanas and the modern yogic lifestyle.<br><br> Robert Love traces this American obsession from moonlit Tantric rituals in San Francisco to its arrival in New York, where Bernard's teachings were adopted by Wall Streeters and Gilded Age heiresses, who then bankrolled a luxurious ashram on the Hudson River-the first in the nation. Though today's practitioners know little of Bernard, they can thank his salesman's persistence for sustaining our interest in yoga despite generations of naysayers.<br><br> In this surprising, sometimes comic story, Love uncovers the forgotten life and times of the colorful, enigmatic character who brought us hatha yoga. <i>The Great Oom</i> delves into the murky intersection of mysticism, money, and celebrity that gave rise to the creation of one of America's most popular practices and a fivebillion-dollar industry.<br><br></p><p>Robert Love was the managing editor of <i>Rolling Stone</i> and executive editor of <i>Best Life</i>.

Composer, keyboardist, bandleader, philosopher, poet, and self-proclaimed extraterrestrial from Saturn, Sun Ra led his "Intergalactic Arkestra" of thirty-plus musicians in a career that ranged from boogie-woogie and swing to be-bop, free jazz, fusion, and New Age music.

The habit intrigues the religious and the nonreligious alike, from medieval maidens to contemporary schoolboys, to feminists and other social critics. The first book to explore the symbolism of this attire, <i>The Habit</i> presents a visual gallery of the diverse forms of religious clothing and explains the principles and traditions that inspired them. More than just an eye-opening study of the symbolic significance of starched wimples, dark dresses, and flowing veils, <i>The Habit</i> is an incisive, engaging portrait of the roles nuns have and do play in the Catholic Church and in ministering to the needs of society.<br><br>From the clothing seen in an eleventh-century monastery to the garb worn by nuns on picket lines during the 1960s, habits have always been designed to convey a specific image or ideal. The habits of the Benedictines and the Dominicans, for example, were specifically created to distinguish women who consecrated their lives to God; other habits reflected the sisters&#x2019; desire to blend in among the people they served. The brown Carmelite habit was rarely seen outside the monastery wall, while the <i>Flying Nun</i> turned the white winged cornette of the Daughters of Charity into a universally recognized icon. And when many religious abandoned habits in the 1960s and &#x2019;70s, it stirred a debate that continues today.<br><br>Drawing on archival research and personal interviews with nuns all over the United States, Elizabeth Kuhns examines some of the gender and identity issues behind the controversy and brings to light the paradoxes the habit represents. For some, it epitomizes oppression and obsolescence; for others, it embodies the ultimate beauty and dignity of the vocation.<br><br>Complete with extraordinary photographs, including images of the nineteenth century nuns&#x2019; silk bonnets to the simple gray dresses of the Sisters of Social Service, this evocative narrative explores the timeless symbolism of the habit and traces its evolution as a visual reflection of the changes in society.</p><p>"If you ever needed proof that clothes make the woman, here it is. The Habit reveals why these distinctive garments still possess a sense of mystery and awe for us in the post modern world. Elizabeth Kuhns readable account chronicles the development of the habit, while pointing to the important witness of the veil in the future. Ms. Kuhns may just be a fashion prophetess. Bravo." -Raymond Arroyo EWTNews Director <p>The Habit is both a history of Catholic religious garb and an analysis of the ongoing popular fascination with it. Drawing upon extensive research and numerous interviews, Elizabeth Kuhns has written a book that is at once useful to the scholar and accessible to the general reader.

When I launched my line of eco-tool bags, they hosted business parties at their restaurants, serving food that had a mission that was in sync with mine and that deeply impressed a number of fashion editors.<br><br>And a Candle Thanksgiving is a treat!&nbsp;<br><br> It&#x2019;s truly magical and special, full of fabulous tastes with no bad karma flying around the belly after dinner.<br><br> I am so thrilled that Joy, Angel, and Jorge decided to write a book devoted to cooking vegan for the holidays. In addition to the great menus and recipes, the photography and layout of this book are beautiful, and I want to make almost everything I see on these pages RIGHT NOW! Bravo!<br><br> This book is about celebration and fun&#x2014;no deprivation, just pure joy and yumminess. It inspires me to plan a year of parties, and I am so eager to cook Joy&#x2019;s Grandma&#x2019;s seitan brisket and sweet potato latkes for Passover, and mini muffins and French toast coffeecake for my friends and all their kiddies for a spring brunch. There&#x2019;s the Cinco de Mayo fiesta (Bear&#x2019;s birthday) with crispy black bean tacos and caramel flan (I&#x2019;ve had this at Candle 79 and it is insane!), and a cruelty-free backyard barbecue with grilled seitan burgers and spicy corn on the cob finished off with red, white, &amp; blue shortcake. <br><br>Maybe I&#x2019;ll have a holiday mash-up, serving the best of Thanksgiving and Christmas with a roasted brussels sprout salad, the polenta, mushroom, and kale casserole, Christmas spritz cookies, and a vegan cheese plate! OMG! And for Valentine&#x2019;s maybe I&#x2019;ll make a romantic dinner with roasted red pepper soup and dumplings, morel crusted tofu, and decadent molten chocolate cake. Seriously, I want to eat all of these things&#x2014;right now.<br><br> I love Candle&#x2019;s commitment and passion for sustainability, for healing the planet with food and love. Thank God for the Candles and for Joy and Bart and Angel and Jorge.<br><br> And for this book. We are all so lucky to have this book.

But for all that's been written, little has focused on his faith and how this quality shaped the man who led our country during its most tumultuous years. <br> <br> Author Joe Wheeler, historian and scholar, brings to the pages of this insightful book the knowledge gleaned from over ten years of study and more than sixty books on the life and times of Abraham Lincoln. Skillfully weaving his own narrative with direct quotes from Lincoln and poignant excerpts from other Lincoln biographers, Wheeler brings a refreshingly friendly rendition of Lincoln's life, faith, and courage. <br> <br> The stories, historical details, and powerful quotes on the pages of this book will leave a lasting impression on your heart, your mind, and your life.</p><p>Joe Wheeler is considered one of America&#x2019;s leading story anthology creators. His bestselling <i>Christmas in My Heart</i> story anthology is the longest running Christmas story series in America. Wheeler earned a master&#x2019;s in history from Pacific Union College, a master&#x2019;s in English from Sacramento State University, and a PhD in English from Vanderbilt University. He lives with his wife in Conifer, Colorado.Despite the title, this serviceable one-volume biography of Lincoln does not dwell on either his faith or his courage. Instead, author Joe Wheeler touches on both themes throughout to illustrate Lincoln&#39;s major achievements. A further subtitle describes the book as &#34;stories,&#34; which is an apt description. The author recounts a series of anecdotes culled from extensive research (which the author himself reminds readers of more than once). They are interesting and informative. This story structure and its conversational style adapt well to audio. Grover Gardner carries just the right tone as narrator. His voice is folksy without losing the seriousness needed in reading about the grave issues that confronted Lincoln. In direct quotations, he slows his reading slightly but doesn&#39;t adopt special voices, which would sound forced.

Poor Bevel Lemelisk, the inventor of the Empire's signature moon-size battle station, has done just that, and now he's in the service of Durga the Hutt (only a marginal improvement over working for Emperor Palpatine, who was in the habit of gruesomely executing Lemelisk, only to recombobulate him into a newly cloned body). <p>It's eight years after the battle of Endor, and the Hutts are hoping to make a galactic power play using Lemelisk's latest project, a sort of cylindrical Death Star superlaser-on-steroids, dubbed Darksaber. But the newly empowered Rebels and the recovering Empire aren't sitting idle. As the book opens, Han and Luke are sneaking their way across Tatooine's Dune Sea, dressed in Tusken drag. Luke's looking to commune with Obi-Wan to learn how to save his Jedi squeeze, Callista, recently rescued from the innards of the ship computer on Palpatine's super-duper Star Destroyer. Meanwhile, the ranks of the Imperial Fleet swell under the charismatic Admiral Daala. Will Luke help Callista touch the Force again? Where will Daala's fleet strike a blow against the New Republic? Will Lemelisk's new invention hold together long enough to save his own hide? The skilled Kevin J. Anderson sure makes it fun to find out. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>Rave reviews for previous Star Wars adventures:<p>"Anderson has all but assumed the title of Chancellor of Star Wars University."<br><i>-- Starlog</i></p><p>"Chock full of all the good stuff you've come to expect from a battle of good against evil."<br><i>-- Daily News</i>, New York </p><p></p></p><h2>Savage Country (The Last Gunfighter)</h2><p>When his estranged son, an Eastern businessman trying to build a railroad through the wild New Mexico Territory, asks for his help, Frank Morgan, along with a gun-toting beauty named Rebel, rides straight into an Apache war controlled by a criminal mastermind who is determined to kill both Morgans.

The sun razored open the downtown corridor, slicing past the construction cranes waiting to dip into the earth and pull up skyscrapers, hotels, convention centers. Frost spiderwebbed across the parks. Fog drifted through the streets. Trees slowly straightened their spines. The wet, ripe meat of the city lurched toward the November light.<br><br>The only sound was footsteps.<br><br>Heavy slaps echoed between the buildings as Jimmy Lawson&#x2019;s police-issue boots pounded the pavement. Sweat poured from his skin. His left knee wanted to give. His body was a symphony of pain. Every muscle was a plucked piano wire. His teeth gritted like a sand block. His heart was a snare drum.<br><br>The black granite Equitable Building cast a square shadow as he crossed Pryor Street. How many blocks had Jimmy gone? How many more did he have to go?<br><br>Don Wesley was thrown over his shoulder like a sack of flour. Fireman&#x2019;s carry. Harder than it looked. Jimmy&#x2019;s shoulder was ablaze. His spine drilled into his tailbone. His arm trembled from the effort of keeping Don&#x2019;s legs clamped to his chest. The man could already be dead. He wasn&#x2019;t moving. His head tapped into the small of Jimmy&#x2019;s back as he barreled down Edgewood faster than he&#x2019;d ever carried the ball down the field. He didn&#x2019;t know if it was Don&#x2019;s blood or his own sweat that was rolling down the back of his legs, pooling into his boots.<br><br>He wouldn&#x2019;t survive this. There was no way a man could survive this.<br><br>The gun had snaked around the corner. Jimmy had watched it slither past the edge of a cinder-block wall. The sharp fangs of the front sights jutted up from the tip of the barrel. Raven MP-25. Six-round detachable box, blowback action, semiauto. The classic Saturday night special. Twenty-five bucks on any ghetto corner.<br><br>That&#x2019;s what his partner&#x2019;s life had come down to. Twenty-five bucks.<br><br>Jimmy faltered as he ran past First Atlanta Bank. His left knee almost touched the asphalt. Only adrenaline and fear saved him from falling. Quick bursts of recall kept setting off colorful fireworks in his head: Red shirtsleeve bunched up around a yellow-gold wristwatch. Black-gloved hand holding the white pearl grip. The rising sun had bathed the weapon&#x2019;s dark steel in a bluish light. It didn&#x2019;t seem right that something black could have a glint to it, but the gun had almost glowed.<br><br>And then the finger pulled back on the trigger.<br><br>Jimmy knew the workings of a gun. The 25&#x2019;s slide was already racked, cartridge in the chamber. The trigger spring engaged the firing pin. The firing pin hit the primer. The primer ignited the gunpowder. The bullet flew from the chamber. The casing popped out of the ejection port.<br><br>Don&#x2019;s head exploded.<br><br>Jimmy&#x2019;s memory did no work to raise the image. The violence was etched into his corneas, backdropped every time he blinked. Jimmy was looking at Don, then he was looking at the gun, then he was looking at how the side of Don&#x2019;s face had distorted into the color and texture of a rotten piece of fruit.<br><br>Click-click.<br><br>The gun had jammed. Otherwise, Jimmy wouldn&#x2019;t be running down the street right now. He would be face down in an alley beside Don, condoms and cigarette butts and needles sticking to their skin.<br><br>Gilmer Street. Courtland. Piedmont. Three more blocks. His knee could hold out for three more blocks.<br><br>Jimmy had never been on the business end of a firing gun. The flash was an explosion of starlight&#x2014;millions of pinpricked pieces of sun lighting up the dark alley. His eardrums rang with the sound. His eyes stung from the cordite. At the same time, he felt the splash against his skin, like hot water, only he knew&#x2014;he knew&#x2014;it was blood and bone and pieces of flesh hitting his chest, his neck, his face. He tasted it on his tongue. Crunched the bone between his teeth.<br><br>Don Wesley&#x2019;s blood. Don Wesley&#x2019;s bone.<br><br>He was blinded by it.<br><br>When Jimmy was a kid, his mother used to make him take his sister to the pool. She was so little back then. Her skinny, pale legs and arms poking out of her tiny suit reminded Jimmy of a baby praying mantis. In the water, he&#x2019;d cup his hands together, tell her he&#x2019;d caught a bug. She was a girl, but she loved looking at bugs. She&#x2019;d paddle over to see, and Jimmy would squeeze his hands together so the water would squirt into her face. She would scream and scream. Sometimes she would cry, but he&#x2019;d still do it again the next time they were in the pool. Jimmy told himself it was all right because she kept falling for it. The problem wasn&#x2019;t that he was cruel. The problem was that she was stupid.<br><br>Where was she now? Safe in bed, he hoped. Fast asleep, he prayed. She was on the job, too. His little sister. It wasn&#x2019;t safe. Jimmy could end up carrying her through the streets one day. He could be jostling her limp body, careening around the corner, his knee brushing the blacktop as the torn ligaments clashed like cymbals.<br><br>Jimmy saw a glowing sign up ahead: a white field with a red cross in the center.<br><br>Grady Hospital.<br><br>He wanted to weep. He wanted to fall to the ground. But his burden would not lighten. If anything, Don got heavier. The last twenty yards were the hardest of Jimmy&#x2019;s life.<br><br>A group of black men were congregating under the sign. They were dressed in bright purples and greens. Their tight pants flared below the knee, showing a touch of white patent leather. Thick sideburns. Pencil mustaches. Gold rings on their fingers. Cadillacs parked a few feet away. The pimps were always in front of the hospital this time of morning. They smoked skinny cigars and watched the sun rise as they waited for their girls to get patched up for the morning rush hour.<br><br>None of them offered to help the two bloody cops making their way toward the doors. They gawked. Their cigarillos stopped midair.<br><br>Jimmy fell against the glass doors. Someone had forgotten to lock them. They butterflied open. His knee slued to the side. He fell face-first into the emergency waiting room. The jolt was like a bad tackle. Don&#x2019;s hipbone knifed into his chest. Jimmy felt the flex of his own ribs kissing his heart.<br><br>He looked up. At least fifty pairs of eyes stared back. No one said a word. Somewhere in the bowels of the treatment area, a phone was ringing. The sound echoed through the barred doors.<br><br>The Gradys. Over a decade of civil rights hadn&#x2019;t done shit. The waiting room was still divided: black on one side, white on the other. Like the pimps under the sign, they all stared at Jimmy. At Don Wesley. At the river of blood flowing beneath them.<br><br>Jimmy was still on top of Don. It was a lewd scene, one man on top of another. One cop on top of another. Still, Jimmy cradled his hand to Don&#x2019;s face. Not the side that was blown open&#x2014;the side that still looked like his partner.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; Jimmy managed, though he knew it wasn&#x2019;t okay. Would never be okay. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right.&#x201d;<br><br>Don coughed.<br><br>Jimmy&#x2019;s gut twisted at the sound. He&#x2019;d been sure the man was dead. &#x201c;Get help,&#x201d; he told the crowd, but it was a whisper, a begging little girl&#x2019;s voice that came out of his own mouth. &#x201c;Somebody get help.&#x201d;<br><br>Don groaned. He was trying to speak. The flesh of his cheek was gone. Jimmy could see his tongue lolling between shattered bone and teeth.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d; Jimmy&#x2019;s voice was still a high whistle. He looked up again. No one would meet his gaze. There were no nurses. No doctors. No one was going to get help. No one was answering the damn telephone.<br><br>Don groaned again. His tongue slacked outside of his jaw.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; Jimmy repeated. Tears streamed down his face. He felt sick and dizzy. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s gonna be okay.&#x201d;<br><br>Don inhaled sharply, like he was surprised. He held the air in his lungs for a few seconds before finally letting out a low, baleful moan. Jimmy felt the sound vibrating in his chest. Don&#x2019;s breath was sour&#x2014;the smell of a soul leaving the body. The color of his flesh didn&#x2019;t drain so much as fill like a pitcher of cold buttermilk. His lips turned an earthy, funereal blue. The fluorescent lights cut white stripes into the flat green of his irises.<br><br>Jimmy felt a darkness pass through him. It gripped his throat, then slowly reached its icy fingers into his chest. He opened his mouth for air, then forced it closed for fear that Don&#x2019;s ghost would flow into him.<br><br>Somewhere, the phone was still ringing.<br><br>&#x201c;She-it,&#x201d; a raspy old woman grumbled. &#x201c;Doctor ain&#x2019;t never gone get to me now.&#x201d;<br><br>Day One<br><br>Monday<br><br>1<br><br>Maggie Lawson was upstairs in her bedroom when she heard the phone ringing in the kitchen. She checked her watch. There was nothing good about a phone ringing this early in the morning. Sounds from the kitchen echoed up the back stairs: The click of the receiver being lifted from the cradle. The low murmur of her mother&#x2019;s voice. The sharp snap of the phone cord slapping the floor as she walked back and forth across the kitchen.<br><br>The linoleum had been worn away in staggered gray lines from the countless times Delia Lawson had paced the kitchen listening to bad news.<br><br>The conversation didn&#x2019;t last long. Delia hung up the phone. The loud click echoed up to the rafters. Maggie knew every sound the old house made. She had spent a lifetime studying its moods. Even from her room, she could follow her mother&#x2019;s movements through the kitchen: The refrigerator door opening and closing. A cabinet banging shut. Eggs being cracked into a bowl. Thumb flicking her Bic to light a cigarette.<br><br>Maggie knew how this would go. Delia had been playing Bad-News Blackjack for as long as Maggie could remember. She would hold for a while, but then tonight, tomorrow, or maybe even a week from now, Delia would pick a fight with Maggie and the minute Maggie opened her mouth to respond, her mother would lay down her cards: the electric bill was past due, her shifts at the diner had been cut, the car needed a new transmission, and here Maggie was making things worse by talking back and for the love of God, couldn&#x2019;t she give her mother a break?<br><br>Busted. Dealer wins.<br><br>Maggie screeched the ironing board closed. She stepped carefully around folded stacks of laundry. She&#x2019;d been up since five that morning doing the family&#x2019;s ironing. She was Sisyphus in a bathrobe. They all had uniforms of one kind or another. Lilly wore green-and-blue-checkered skirts and yellow button-down tops to school. Jimmy and Maggie had their dark blue pants and long-sleeved shirts from the Atlanta Police Department. Delia had her green polyester smocks from the diner. And then they all came home and changed into regular clothes, which meant that every day, Maggie was washing and ironing for eight people instead of four.<br><br>She only complained when no one could hear her.<br><br>There was a scratching sound from Lilly&#x2019;s room as she dropped the needle on a record. Maggie gritted her teeth. Tapestry. Lilly played the album incessantly.<br><br>Not too long ago, Maggie helped Lilly get dressed for school every morning. At night, they would page through Brides magazine and clip out pictures for their dream weddings. That was all before Lilly turned thirteen years old and her life, much like Carole King&#x2019;s, became an everlasting vision of the ever-changing hue.<br><br>She waited for Jimmy to bang on the wall and tell Lilly to turn that crap off, but then she remembered her brother had picked up a night shift. Maggie looked out the window. Jimmy&#x2019;s car wasn&#x2019;t in the driveway. Unusually, the neighbor&#x2019;s work van was gone. She wondered if he was working the night shift, too. And then she chastened herself for wondering, because it was none of her business what her neighbor was doing.<br><br>Now seemed as good a time as any to go down for breakfast. Maggie pulled the foam rollers from her hair as she walked down the stairs. She stopped exactly in the middle. The acoustic sweet spot. Tapestry disappeared. There were no sounds from the kitchen. If Maggie timed it right, she could sometimes grab a full minute of silence standing on the stairs. There wouldn&#x2019;t be another time during her day when she felt so completely alone.<br><br>She took a deep breath, then slowly let it out before continuing down.<br><br>The old Victorian had been grand at one point, though the house retained no evidence of its former glory. Pieces of siding were gone. Rotted wood hung like bats from the gables. The windows rattled with the slightest breeze. Rain shot a creek through the basement. There was no outlet in the house that didn&#x2019;t have a black tattoo ghosted around it from bad fuses and shoddy workmanship.<br><br>Even though it was winter, the kitchen was humid. No matter the time of year, it always smelled of fried bacon and cigarette smoke. The source of both stood at the stove. Delia&#x2019;s back was bent as she filled the percolator. When Maggie thought of her mother, she thought of this kitchen&#x2014;the faded avocado-green appliances, the cracked yellow linoleum on the floor, the burned, black ridges on the laminate countertop where her father rested his cigarettes.<br><br>As usual, Delia had been up since before Maggie. No one knew what Delia did in the morning hours. Probably curse God that she&#x2019;d woken up in the same house with the same problems. There was an unwritten rule that you didn&#x2019;t go downstairs until you heard eggs being whisked in a bowl. Delia always cooked a big breakfast, a holdover from her Depression childhood, when breakfast might be the only meal of the day.<br><br>&#x201c;Lilly up?&#x201d; Delia hadn&#x2019;t turned around, but she knew Maggie was there.<br><br>&#x201c;For now.&#x201d; Maggie made the same offer she did every morning. &#x201c;Can I do anything?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; Delia jabbed the bacon with a fork. &#x201c;Driveway&#x2019;s empty next door.&#x201d;<br><br>Maggie glanced out the window, pretending she didn&#x2019;t already know Lee Grant&#x2019;s van was not parked in its usual spot.<br><br>Delia said, &#x201c;All we need is for girls to start going in and out of that house at all hours. Again.&#x201d;<br><br>Maggie leaned against the counter. Delia looked exhausted. Even her stringy brown hair couldn&#x2019;t be bothered to stay pinned on the top of her head. They&#x2019;d all been picking up extra shifts to pay for Lilly to go to a private school. None of them wanted to see her bussed across town to the ghetto. They had four more years of tuition and textbooks and uniforms before Lilly graduated. Maggie wasn&#x2019;t sure her mother would last that long.</p><h2>The Freedom Factor</h2><p><p>Bryce Sherwood, a young senatorial aide whose star is rising, is a key player in an attempt to pass an amendment that would eliminate the checks and balances built into the Constitution.

She was poised to make a decision of grand importance.</p><p>Camille Cacciatore, also fourteen, was there to help her. The girls had done many creative things in this tiny room: composed plays, written songs, and practiced signing their names with fl orid capital <i>C</i>'s and curlicuing final <i>e</i>'s -- readying themselves for stardom. But today's enterprise was larger. Camille inched Carole's desk chair over to the bed so both could read the small print on the tissue-thin pages of the cardboard-bound volume resting on the bedspread between them. Carole was going to find herself a new last name, and she was going to find it the best way she knew how: in the Brooklyn phone book.</p><p>Camille Cacciatore envied her best friend. "Cacciatore is much worse than Klein! I wanna change my name, too!" Camille had wailed -- gratuitously, since both girls knew Camille's father would blow his stack if his daughter came home with a new appellation. Mr. Cacciatore, a transit authority draftsman, was stricter than Mr. Klein, a New York City fireman who, having retired on disability, now sold insurance.</p><p>Not that Sidney Klein still lived with Carole and her schoolteacher mother, Eugenia, whom everyone called Genie, in the downstairs apartment of the small two-story brick house at 2466 East Twenty-fourth Street, between Avenues X and Y, in Sheepshead Bay. Carole's parents had recently divorced -- a virtual first in the neighborhood -- but Sidney came around frequently, and Carole's friends suspected that her parents still loved each other.</p><p>So Carole alone could change her name, just as Carole alone was allowed to attend those magical Alan Freed shows (Camille's parents disapproved of "that jungle music"), often making the pilgrimage to the Paramount <i>both</i> weekend nights to soak up the plaintive doo-wop of the Platters, Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, and Queens's very own Cleftones, as well as the dazzling piano banging of Jerry Lee Lewis. Freed had coined the term "rock 'n' roll" three years earlier, when, as a white Ohio deejay affecting a Negro style and calling himself Moondog, he was spinning discs after midnight for a black audience that grew to include a swelling tide of white teenagers starved for the powerful honesty of "race music." Now, in his Brooklyn mecca, Freed drew hordes of fans -- and fans destined to be heirs. Carole was among the latter.</p><p>The two girls hunched over the phone book and paged past the front matter -- the sketch of the long-distance operator, in her tight perm and headset, ready to connect a Brooklynite to Detroit or St. Louis or even San Francisco; the <i>Warning!</i> that it was a misdemeanor to fail to relinquish a party line in an emergency. They fl attened the book at page 694: where the J section turned into the K section. Carole wanted a name that sounded like Klein: K, one syllable. "We were very systematic," Camille recalls. Line by line, column by column, they looked and considered and eliminated.</p><p><i>Kahn...Kalb...Kamp...:</i> Somewhere between Kearns Funeral Home and Krasilovsky Trucking, there had to be the perfect name (or, failing that, an okay one that didn't sound ethnic) to transport the young tunesmith to her longed-for destiny.</p><p>Best friends for two years now, Carole and Camille had walked the four blocks to Shellbank Junior High every day. Now they made the longer trek to James Madison High School, where the sons and daughters of lower-middle-class Jews (Italian families like Camille's were a distinct minority) roiled with creative energy. So did the kids from Madison's rival, Lincoln High, and those from another nearby high school, Erasmus Hall. The cramped houses from which these students tumbled each morning were the fi fty-years-later counterparts of the tenements of the Lower East Side, where hardworking parents had sacrificed to give their offspring the tools to make culture -- musical culture, especially. In fact, so alike were the two generations that, today, Camille Cacciatore Savitz's most lasting impression of the interiors of those small houses -- "Every house had a piano! To not have a piano...it was like not having a bed in those houses!" she marvels -- uncannily echoing what a Lower East Side settlement-house worker wrote in a 1906 report: "There is not a house, no matter how poor it be, where there is not...a piano or a violin, and where the hope of the whole family is not pinned on one of the younger set as a future genius."</p><p>But there was a difference: those young Lower East Side pianist-songwriters had romanticized high-society top-hatters and New England white Christmases. Their World War II-born Brooklyn counterparts, Carole and her peers -- with their opposite sense of romance -- would soon be extolling the humanity found within the very kinds of tenements those earlier songwriters had struggled to escape. </p><p>The piano in the small Klein living room was always in use, by Carole. The commercial tunes that sprang from her fingers combined the rigor of the classical music she'd studied with the wondrous Negro sounds she was absorbing at the Freed shows and on the radio. Carole's father helped her record them onto "demos," but aiding his daughter's career dream didn't make him any less proprietary toward her. Carole was expected to steer a clear path from high school to college, where she would stay four years, obtain her teaching credential, and get married -- no crazy surprises. In civil-service Jewish families, people were <i>menschen</i>: substantial, sensible.</p><p>This was 1956. Mr. and Mrs. Ricky Ricardo had separate beds on <i>I Love Lucy</i>. Dissemination of information about birth control to married women was a crime in some states. Every word of <i>Seventeen</i> magazine was vetted by a pastor. In garment factories, union inspectors checked skirt lengths before job lots were shipped to department stores. Elvis may have been singing, Jack Kerouac writing, and James Dean's movies still being shown even after his fatal car accident, but there were few female analogues. Doris Day pluckily kept wolves at bay; the Chordettes crooned like estrogened Perry Comos. The 1920s had their flappers; the 1930s, their fox-stole-draped society aviatrixes, cheerfully trundling off to Reno for divorces; the 1940s had Rosie the Riveter. But the deep middle of the 1950s had both the most constricted images of women and (until just recently) the worst popular music of all the previous four decades: a double punch that could be considered a privation -- <i>or</i> a springboard.</p><p>In 1956 girls weren't agents of their sexuality, much less gamblers with it. No girl would have dared sing about how she'd weighed the physical and emotional (<i>not</i> the moral) drawbacks of sex -- getting pregnant, feeling used -- against the greater pull of the act's transcendent pleasure, or how she'd wondered, in the midst of sex, if the boy would drop her afterward. You couldn't get such a song on the radio, even if one existed. In a few years, however, Carole would write that song, based on events in her own life, and the resulting record would be the casual opening salvo of a revolution.</p><p><i>Karl...Kass...Katz...:</i> Carole and Camille were getting hungry. That meant a trip to Camille's house on Twenty-sixth Street. Genie Klein didn't cook much; sometimes she just laid out a jar of borscht and an entr�e of "dairy" (cottage cheese, sour cream, cucumbers, scallions) with rye bread and shav, a bitter drink that made Camille almost puke when she tasted it. Mary Cacciatore, on the other hand, cooked like Mario Lanza sang: passionately. Carole would raid the Cacciatores' icebox for peppers and onions or spaghetti and meatballs.</p><p>One bond between Camille and Carole was their self-perceived beauty deficiency. Although she had fetchingly upturned eyes, Carole's narrow face was unremarkable; she rued her too-curly hair, and, as Camille says, "she really didn't like her nose." Carole may have suspected that the boys at Madison did not regard her as a beauty. "She was a plain-looking girl with messy hair and ordinary clothes," says then Madison High upper classman Al Kasha, who also became a songwriter. "But at the piano, in the music room, playing Rachmaninoff and Tchaikovsky, she was a different person -- she came alive." She had an internal compass, and she hung her self-esteem squarely on her talent.</p><p>Though this would be hard to imagine in 1956, when standards of feminine beauty were at their most unforgiving, in fifteen years Carole would represent an inclusive new model of female sensuality: the young "natural" woman, the "earth mother." The album that would afford her this status would, five years after its release, stand as the biggest-selling album in the history of the record industry; would settle out as one of the biggest-selling albums of the 1970s; and then and for years after, would remain the biggest-selling album written and recorded by a woman. It would singularly define its several-years-slice of the young American experience.</p><p>Carole's album's historic success would raise the stock of other singer-songwriters (a concept she would help establish) who were women, and it would constitute a Cinderella story with a moral: a behind-the-scenes songwriter and simple borough girl becomes a pop star without changing herself in the slightest. She would have come a long way from those grim negotiations with her teenage mirror. Yet her success was so enormous and early that every subsequent effort would be measured negatively against it. The unpretty girl who'd earned her fortune through hard work and talent would, ironically, find her fate mimicking that of the too-pretty girl who'd dined out a bit too long on early-peaking beauty.</p><p><i>Kaye...Kean...Kehl...:</i> Maybe this weekend the girls would catch a fl ick at the Sheepshead Bay theater: Carole with Joel Zwick, Camille wi...</p></p><h2>The Light of the World: A Memoir</h2><p><b>A deeply resonant<i> </i>memoir for anyone who has loved and lost that is at once "remarkably uplifting" (<i>Washington Post</i>) and "crushing, lovely, painful, and above all powerful" (<i>New York Journal of Books</i>), from acclaimed poet and Pulitzer Prize finalist Elizabeth Alexander.</b><b><br><br>* Pulitzer Prize Finalist</b><b><br>* National Book Critics Circle Award Finalist</b><b><br>* A <i>New Yorker,</i> NPR, <i>Boston Globe,</i> <i>Publisher's Weekly, Newsday, Library Journal, </i>People.com, Shelf Awareness, <i>The Root</i>, and <i>St. Louis Dispact </i>Best Book Pick</b><b><br>* First Lady Michelle Obama's Favorite Book of 2015</b><b><i><br>* New York Times Book Review </i></b><b>Editor's Choice</b><b><br>* An Amazon's Best Book of the Month</b><b><br>* #1 Indie Next Pick</b> <br><br>In <i>The Light of the World</i>, Elizabeth Alexander finds herself at an existential crossroads after the sudden death of her husband. Channeling her poetic sensibilities into a rich, lucid price, Alexander tells a love story that is, itself, a story of loss. As she reflects on the beauty of her married life, the trauma resulting from her husband's death, and the solace found in caring for her two teenage sons, Alexander universalizes a very personal quest for meaning and acceptance in the wake of loss.<br><br> <i>The Light of the World</i> is at once an endlessly compelling memoir and a deeply felt meditation on the blessings of love, family, art, and community. It is also a lyrical celebration of a life well-lived and a paean to the priceless gift of human companionship. For those who have loved and lost, or for anyone who cares what matters most, <i>The Light of the World </i>is required reading.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of April 2015:</strong> Elizabeth Alexander&#x2019;s memoir of her marriage and the sudden death of her husband is by turns sorrowful and joyful, earthy and elegiac, deeply personal and achingly universal. Alexander, an acclaimed poet perhaps best known for the poem she delivered at Barack Obama&#x2019;s first inauguration, is a professor at Yale. (In an aside, she reveals that she is only the 3rd African American woman to get tenure at that University.) Her husband, Ficre, was an Eritrean who&#x2019;d survived civil war in Africa to become a chef and artist in America; their marriage, as chronicled here, was a triumph of politics, society and romance. It was not without its secrets or its difficulties, but it was clearly a happy, no, make that a joyful union; the pleasures of cooking together (Alexander sometimes includes recipes), entertaining a huge, international group of family and friends and raising their two precocious boys is palpable on every mellifluous page. Like Joan Didion, Meghan O&#x2019;Rourke and Roger Rosenblatt before her, Alexander here faces the unfaceable topic of loss -- and almost convinces us &#x2013; and herself &#x2013; that despite her terrible grief, she is grateful for the life and love that preceded it. --<em>Sara Nelson </em></p><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b> is a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets and the Wun Tsun Tam Mellon Professor in the Humanities at Columbia University.

Sticks: A Remarkable Way to Adapt to Changing Times and Keep Your Work Fresh</h2><p>The 'o-FISH!-al' follow-up to the phenomenal bestselling <em>Fish!</em> and <em>Fish! Tales</em>, <em>Fish! Sticks</em> is a stand-alone business parable that shows you how to come up with a vision for your business and how to keep it alive, vital, and renewed through tough times, such as turnover in management and staff or a troubled economy. Using the example of a hugely successful, fictional sushi restaurant as a model for a vision of continual renewal,<em> Fish! Sticks</em> employs the same kind of easy-to-read story that was used in <em>Fish!</em> to illustrate its three major principals of continued success: Commit, Be It, and Coach It.<br><br> When Stephanie, a new manager, takes over from a wildly popular and now promoted boss, she is faced with the problem of how to keep spirits up in a corporate unit that has, frankly, started to get bored and cranky and revert to its old ways. But then she visits the amazing Taka Sushi (formerly Taka Teriyaki), with its lines of customers cheerfully waiting for hours to get in. Soon, she realizes that the way to keep her employees motivated and her customers delighted can be learned from a bunch of waiters who teach one another everything they need to know. And when she finds out just how the owner of Taka knew to switch her main bill of fare from teriyaki to sushi long before anyone else, what she really discovers is the secret of keeping your work fresh.</p><p>In this third installment in the popular <i>Fish!</i> series, the authors examine change as a necessary, ongoing process that should never stop--at least not if one wants to keep the workplace vital and fully alive. Using a fictitious sushi restaurant as an example, this fable examines the three principles that Lundin, Christensen, and Paul believe are necessary for continuing success: Find It ("it" being each employee's personal vision of the business), Live It, and Coach It. Readers of the authors' previous books--<i>Fish! A Remarkable Way to Boost Morale and Improve Results</i> and <i>Fish! Tales</i>--should find its familiarity comforting. For those new to the series, this standalone volume is easy to read and highly valuable. <i>--David Bombeck</i><strong>Stephen C.

It is the story of four seekers who arrive at a notoriously unfriendly pile called Hill House: Dr. Montague, an occult scholar looking for solid evidence of a &#x201c;haunting&#x201d;; Theodora, his lighthearted assistant; Eleanor, a friendless, fragile young woman well acquainted with poltergeists; and Luke, the future heir of Hill House. At first, their stay seems destined to be merely a spooky encounter with inexplicable phenomena. But Hill House is gathering its powers&#x2014;and soon it will choose one of them to make its own.<br> &nbsp;<br> For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.</p><p>Shirley Jackson's <i>The Haunting of Hill House</i> has unnerved readers since its original publication in 1959. A tale of subtle, psychological terror, it has earned its place as one of the significant haunted house stories of the ages. <p> Eleanor Vance has always been a loner--shy, vulnerable, and bitterly resentful of the 11 years she lost while nursing her dying mother. "She had spent so long alone, with no one to love, that it was difficult for her to talk, even casually, to another person without self-consciousness and an awkward inability to find words." Eleanor has always sensed that one day something <i>big</i> would happen, and one day it does. She receives an unusual invitation from Dr. John Montague, a man fascinated by "supernatural manifestations." He organizes a ghost watch, inviting people who have been touched by otherworldly events. A paranormal incident from Eleanor's childhood qualifies her to be a part of Montague's bizarre study--along with headstrong Theodora, his assistant, and Luke, a well-to-do aristocrat. They meet at Hill House--a notorious estate in New England. </p><p> Hill House is a foreboding structure of towers, buttresses, Gothic spires, gargoyles, strange angles, and rooms within rooms--a place "without kindness, never meant to be lived in...." </p><p>Although Eleanor's initial reaction is to flee, the house has a mesmerizing effect, and she begins to feel a strange kind of bliss that entices her to stay. Eleanor is a magnet for the supernatural--she hears deathly wails, feels terrible chills, and sees ghostly apparitions. Once again she feels isolated and alone--neither Theo nor Luke attract so much eerie company. But the physical horror of Hill House is always subtle; more disturbing is the emotional torment Eleanor endures. Intense, literary, and harrowing, <i>The Haunting of Hill House</i> belongs in the same dark league as Henry James's classic ghost story, <i>The Turn of the Screw</i>. <i>--Naomi Gesinger</i></p><b>Shirley Jackson</b> (1916&#x2013;1965) received wide critical acclaim for her short story &#x201c;The Lottery,&#x201d; which was first published in the <i>New Yorker </i>in 1948.

She shifts and warbles in the dark yard, her pink sheen caught in moonlight. I wonder if she&#x2019;s looking up at the spread of stars or if she&#x2019;s facing the farmhouse, watching us. Maybe things like her don&#x2019;t have eyes. Maybe they wander, unseeing, through the world.</p><p>At the edge of the clearing, the sudden shuffle and bob of branches draw my eyes from the ghost. A couple of giggly sophomores I recognize break through the brush and hesitate, half-shadowed, as they scour the hilltop our house sits on.</p><p>They look right past the shimmering pink spirit and focus instead on the cherry tree that sprawls out in front of our porch. The tree&#x2019;s as old as the town itself, planted by my great-great-great- great-grandfather, Jonathan &#x201c;Jack&#x201d; Alroy O&#x2019;Donnell, when he first settled here. He, like Dad, could talk roots into spreading anywhere, but part of the reason Jonathan stayed in Five Fingers was the taste of the cherries that grew on this hill.&nbsp;<i>Like heaven on earth</i>, Dad used to say,&nbsp;<i>like the silent world before anything had gone wrong.</i></p><p>Within months of his arrival, Jonathan had started a farm a couple of miles from here, closer to the water, where the earth mixed with sand. For two generations, the O&#x2019;Donnells built a legacy of roots and branches. It&#x2019;s been four more since the Angerts, my family&#x2019;s mortal enemies, foreclosed on the farm. But the cherries from that land are still sold in grocery stores and farmers&#x2019; markets, at festivals and fairs, beneath hand-painted signs and vinyl banners reading jack&#x2019;s tart.</p><p>The sophomores, Molly Malone and Quincy Northbrook, run toward the tree now, folded in half like they&#x2019;re trying not to block a movie-theater screen. Neither of them sees the ghost, but they both shiver as they pass through her, and Molly stops and glances back. Quincy&#x2019;s halfway up the tree, trying to shake down the empty branches. He hisses at Molly, and she runs to stand below him, folding her shirt up like a grocery bag as a few shriveled cherries drop.</p><p>Gravel crunches then, and headlights swing up the curve of our long driveway. In the tree, Quincy freezes like a raccoon caught robbing a trash can, but Molly&#x2019;s already running, halfway back to the woods with her spoils. At the breathy honk of the car horn, Quincy drops from the branches and takes off full tilt after her.</p><p>Hannah rolls the Subaru&#x2019;s window down and shouts, &#x201c;Yeah, that&#x2019;s right! You&#x2019;d better run, punks!&#x201d; She shakes her head in mock disapproval then looks up at me, affecting surprise. &#x201c;But soft!&#x201d; she calls. &#x201c;What light through yonder window breaks?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s me,&#x201d; I yell back.</p><p>&#x201c;Wait. June? You&#x2019;re positively glowing. I thought that was the east and you were the sun.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, I&#x2019;m ovulating. Common mistake.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, get those incandescent ovaries down here. We&#x2019;ve got death traps and deep-fried John Doe waiting for us.&#x201d;</p><p>I pull on my canvas tennis shoes, swing my leather backpack over my shoulder, and flick the lights off. But something makes me take one last look at my room from the hallway, at the wild constellations of green star stickers Dad and I tacked on my ceiling when I was six years old. I&#x2019;d been sure back then they&#x2019;d glow forever&#x2014;that nothing Dad touched could dim.</p><p>Mom even used to say, &#x201c;June, your daddy&#x2019;s the sun.&#x201d;</p><p>And he was. He could make anything grow. He warmed every room he stepped into. When he touched an animal, it would lie down and nap. He even went away in the winter, like the sun so often did, and without him the house became cold, lethargic.</p><p>It&#x2019;s been almost ten years since he died, and not a single star sticker still glows. But some people are too alive to fully die, their stories too big to disappear, and he was one of them. I see traces of him all over our magic house. I hear him in the creak and groan of the floorboards as the summer nights stretch them, can visualize him sitting at the foot of my bed, saying,&nbsp;<i>Other houses have support beams and foundations. Ours has bones and a heartbeat.</i></p><p>I close my eyes and listen to the house hum and yawn, stretch and curl. Outside, Hannah honks, and I close the door and jog downstairs.</p><p>In the soft light of the kitchen, Mom and Toddy, my stepdad, are laughing and tickling each other like freshmen on a first date while they choose a bottle of white wine from the fridge. Shadow and Grayson are in the living room, standing on the couch, playing a gladiator video game with motion sensors.</p><p>&#x201c;Han&#x2019;s here,&#x201d; I announce, and Grayson screams something like <i>katchaaaaaaw&nbsp;</i>over my words and kicks the air.</p><p>Mom yelps with laughter and squirms in Toddy&#x2019;s arms, turning her sparkly Torch Lake eyes on me. Dad always said they were the first part of her he fell for. They met far away from here, but she was a little piece of home to him, so he swept her up and brought her back with him, because he wanted all the home he could have in one place.</p><p>Mom smooths her T-shirt down over her improbably toned stomach. &#x201c;Tell Hannah hi!&#x201d;</p><p>Toddy wraps her waist in his arms and rests his chin on her head. &#x201c;Go anywhere else after the carnival and you need to let us know, Junie,&#x201d; he adds. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you girls get in any trouble.&#x201d;</p><p><i>&#x201c;Never.&#x201d;&nbsp;</i>I feign indignation and turn down the narrow hall for the door.</p><p>&#x201c;Love you, baby,&#x201d; they both call.</p><p>Outside, the throng of moths surrounding the porch light disperses around me. The hens, as usual, are asleep in the grass beyond the decrepit chicken coop, no cares in the world. As I slide into Hannah&#x2019;s passenger seat, everything feels particularly&nbsp;<i>right&nbsp;</i>in a way I can&#x2019;t explain. Like the whole world&#x2019;s in harmony.</p><p>The house, the woods, the hens. Hannah in her floral minidress and me in my ratty summer tank top and shorts. The spirit.</p><p>I scan the yard for any hint of the wobbly pink thing. &#x201c;Saw the ghost,&#x201d; I tell Hannah.</p><p>Hannah pops a piece of gum into her mouth then holds the pack out for me. &#x201c;Which one?&#x201d;</p><p>The cozy pink presence isn&#x2019;t the only one that has drifted across our yard since before I was born. &#x201c;Feathers,&#x201d; I answer.</p><p>Hannah chews on her lip. &#x201c;Good.&#x201d;</p><p>The other ghost&#x2014;the shadowy one we haven&#x2019;t named, that plume of darkness that makes you feel nauseated and cold if you brush against it&#x2014;only ever appears before something bad happens. Even when we hadn&#x2019;t actually seen the blackish thing, we&#x2019;d know it had been there because all the animals on our land would freak. The always serene hens would flap, peck, break their wings, sometimes even kill one another. The normally merciful coywolves would mutilate rabbits and sparrows and leave their uneaten bodies on our hillside, scatterings of grisly omens. The last time it came was three years ago, the night before our porch collapsed and I broke my foot, but I haven&#x2019;t actually seen the dark ghost in ten years.</p><p>Not since before the worst Bad Thing.</p><p>Hannah starts to reverse down the hill and into the woods. &#x201c;Ugh, your house always makes me feel the feelings. I swear, there&#x2019;s no place more nostalgia inducing than that leaning stack of lumber.&#x201d;</p><p>I nod and look out the window.</p><p>&#x201c;Is she here now?&#x201d; Hannah asks as she reverses slowly down the driveway. &#x201c;Feathers?&#x201d;</p><p>I point out toward a curve in the edge of the forest where I can barely make out a pink tendril caught in moonlight. &#x201c;There,&#x201d; I tell Hannah. She gazes out toward that point with a dreamy, contented smile, then returns to easing down the driveway. &#x201c;I wish you could see her.&#x201d;</p><p>Hannah lifts one shoulder in a shrug. &#x201c;I just like knowing she&#x2019;s there. You know, not everyone gets to be best friends with someone who has a guardian . . . ghost.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Han, if she were my guardian ghost, don&#x2019;t you think she would&#x2019;ve intervened when I got bangs?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who says guardian ghosts don&#x2019;t have a sense of humor?&#x201d;</p><p>When we were little, I saw the pink ghost all the time. Hannah couldn&#x2019;t, but she could&nbsp;<i>feel&nbsp;</i>it. Sometimes we&#x2019;d chase the shimmer across the yard and run through it, as if it were the spray of the sprinkler. It felt soft and lush, like running through a million falling feathers, thus our nickname for it. Dad always called it the Sprite, and when Mom shot him dubious looks&#x2014;&nbsp;<i>you shouldn&#x2019;t toy with the kids like that</i>&#x2014;he&#x2019;d wink and say, &#x201c;You know, L�a, to enter the kingdom of heaven, you must become like a child.&#x201d;</p><p>Then she&#x2019;d smile as she turned back to hanging laundry, or rolling dough over the floured counter, or trailing her fingers along the gauzy wind-rippled drapes, and say, &#x201c;Five Fingers loves its stories.&#x201d; Like most transplants to this place, Mom had a hard time accepting the strange things that happened on our land as anything other than the shared imaginings of wild, summer-dazed minds and a town-wide tendency to exaggerate.</p><p>Five Fingers&nbsp;<i>did&nbsp;</i>love its stories, but Dad&#x2019;s were true. Our house&nbsp;<i>is&nbsp;</i>magic, in some small way. The skinny halls and wallpapered rooms, the gnarled forest that encircled our hill&#x2014;together they do all kinds of impossible things. My whole life kids have crept onto our property at night to make wishes and look for spirits, or to steal cherries from the first Jack&#x2019;s Tart tree with hopes of shrinking their dogs&#x2019; tumors, healing their grandparents&#x2019; melanoma, even clearing up their acne.</p><p>As we pull onto the wooded road beyond my driveway, something flutters in my peripheral vision: the shift of a shadow, the undulation of something inky in front of the gatehouse.</p><p>My blood chills. My stomach clenches, a knot tightens my throat, and there&#x2019;s a jarring halt in my heart. But when I glance in the rearview mirror, there&#x2019;s nothing there. No shadowy thing, no darkness.</p><p><i>It&#x2019;s gone</i>, I tell myself.&nbsp;<i>It&#x2019;s been gone three years. It&#x2019;s not coming back.</i></p><p>Hannah flicks the frayed edge of my jean cut-offs.&nbsp;<i>&#x201c;</i>June?&#x201d; &#x201c;Huh?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You okay? You look sort of . . . not.&#x201d;</p><p>I shake my head. &#x201c;Sorry, just distracted.&#x201d;</p><p><i>It&#x2019;s gone.</i></p><p>Still, tonight&#x2019;s feeling of rightness has been disturbed. Something&nbsp;<i>off&nbsp;</i>buzzes in the air, like a single hornet circling my head, always out of sight.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Two</b></p><p>WE leave Hannah&#x2019;s car parked by Meijer and join the crowd rollicking across the highway toward the high school. The organ music playing on loop in the Tunnel O&#x2019; Love overlaps chaotically with the&nbsp;<i>whoop&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>dingdingding&nbsp;</i>of carnival games, and sweet, fatty smells mingle with the pine in the air.</p><p>We follow the curling path to the red-and-white ticket booth at the entrance to the school&#x2019;s parking lot, and I try to leave behind any thoughts of the dark presence I imagined back at the house.&nbsp;<i>It&#x2019;s gone; it&#x2019;s not coming back. It was never there.</i></p><p>Hannah squeezes my arm and squeals in excitement as we step into the ticket line. She may be painfully shy, but she loves crowds.</p><p>Our friendship couldn&#x2019;t be any more of a teen-TV-drama clich� if we tried: Hannah Kuiper is a shy yet extroverted, violin-playing salutatorian. I&#x2019;m a socially comfortable yet severely introverted underachiever who, if given the option for a weekend excursion, would choose Desert Island over Theme Park. She&#x2019;s a waify, blue- eyed blonde, and I&#x2019;m a dark-eyed, even darker-waved brunette who wore Hannah&#x2019;s current pant size back in the seventh grade. Mom attributes my relative brawn to the fact that I, like Dad, never stop moving.</p><p>As we near the front of the line, Han rises up on her tiptoes, searching the crowd beyond the booth. &#x201c;I think I see Nate Baars,&#x201d; Hannah says.</p><p>&#x201c;How,&#x201d; I say, &#x201c;in this writhing mass of Vineyard Vines shorts and North Face fleeces, did you pick out one little Vineyard Tendril&#x2013;North Freckle?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why are people crowded around him like that?&#x201d; she asks, completely ignoring me. I squint and follow her gaze to the base of the Ferris wheel. Nate&#x2019;s standing with a dozen kids from our school, most of whom have already graduated.</p><p>&#x201c;Weird,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never seen people line up to hear someone make a fart noise with their armpit before. Is that Stephen Niequist with him?&#x201d; I gesture to the rail-thin blond boy in the grandpa cardigan, Hannah&#x2019;s academic rival.</p><p>She shrugs. &#x201c;Weirdly enough, they&#x2019;re friends.&nbsp;<i>No&nbsp;</i>idea what those two have to talk about, but I see Stephen&#x2019;s car at Nate&#x2019;s house all the time.&#x201d;</p><p>Nate and Hannah live on the same street. We used to ride bikes with him when we were kids, before the natural current of high school took him and us in two very different directions. One direction being distinctly&nbsp;<i>toward&nbsp;</i>flatulence-based humor.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe the world&#x2019;s ending and Nate just found out he&#x2019;s allowed to choose one person to save,&#x201d; I suggest. Truthfully, Nate is&nbsp;<i>exactly</i> the kind of boy who might draw a crowd&#x2014;he&#x2019;s all suntanned muscle and shiny, chocolaty hair&#x2014;if he weren&#x2019;t so ridiculous. But he is, and so this visual makes no sense.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe he won the lottery,&#x201d; Hannah says, &#x201c;and now he has fifty new best friends who want a piece of the pie.&#x201d;</p><p>The gaunt woman in the admission booth calls us forward, and we trade twenties for highlighter-pink wristbands. We wander partway down the aisle on the right and stop before the House of Mirrors, staring up at the pink archway over the entrance. &#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; Hannah says gently, taking my hand. She juts her chin toward it. &#x201c;Maybe this year?&#x201d;</p><p>The House of Mirrors was always Dad&#x2019;s favorite, and it&#x2019;s mine too. There&#x2019;s something so thrilling about wandering around only to get yourself un-lost&#x2014;especially when the thing you&#x2019;re lost in blurs the line between dream and reality, possible and impossible. Like our house and our land. Like Dad himself.</p><p>Hannah and I come to this carnival every year, but I haven&#x2019;t been into the House of Mirrors since Dad died.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d; Hannah says, studying me.</p><p>I shake my head. Hannah squeezes my hand then lets go. &#x201c;Maybe next year.&#x201d;</p><p>We stand in silence for a few more seconds, like we&#x2019;re at an altar or a grave and not five feet from a game where you shoot plastic clowns with mounted water guns.</p><p>&#x201c;Huh,&#x201d; Hannah says, breaking the reverie. I glance sidelong at her. Her eyes are back on the group at the bottom of the Ferris wheel. Now that we&#x2019;re closer, it&#x2019;s apparent that Nate is not, in fact, the center of their attention. He and Stephen are standing off-center, a little bit behind the others, and as a gaggle of middle schoolers jostles past, a gap in the group shifts to reveal the person they all seem uniformly focused on. At first, I can only see his back. He&#x2019;s on the tallish side of average and the thinnish side too, but he somehow takes up more space than someone his size should, as if his presence bends everything around itself.</p><p>He turns a bit, and I get a partial view of his profile but I still don&#x2019;t recognize him. Clean-cut dark hair, uniform five-o&#x2019;clock shadow. A T-shirt whiter than I&#x2019;ve managed to keep one in the time it takes to get from the cash register to the door. The kind of dark, slim-fi jeans you can get away with wearing to a Fiv...</p></p><h2>Reflections on Violence (Dover Books on History, Political and Social Science)</h2><p><p>Sorel developed an original and provocative theory on the positive, even creative, role of myth and violence in the historical process. Sorel was a civil servant who fervently believed that only the clearest and most brutal expression of class war could effect lasting social change. This, his most important work, is a passionate outcry for the socialist overthrow of society.<br><i>Reflections on Violence</i> first appeared as a series of articles in <i>Le Mouvement Socialiste</i> in 1906; it appeared in book form two years later, and translations extended its influence around the world. Sorel addresses the factors underlying revolutionary movements and examines the roles of violence (the revolutionary denial of the existing social order) and force (the state's power of coercion). He further explores sources of political power, the weapons of revolutions &#x2014; the insurrection and the general strike &#x2014; and the significant role of "myths" in recruiting and motivating potential revolutionaries.</p><p></p></p><p>Georges Sorel&#39;s Reflections On Violence (1908) remains a controversial text to this day. It unashamedly advocates the use of violence as a means of putting an end to the corrupt politics of bourgeois democracy and of bringing down capitalism. It is both dangerous and fascinating, of enduring importance and interest to all those concerned about the nature of modern politics. This new student edition of Sorel&#39;s classic text is accompanied by notes, chronology, and bibliography, as well as a concise introduction to the context and content of this work.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Book Finds: How to Find, Buy, and Sell Used and Rare Books</h2><p>For the experienced collector or someone embarking on a new hobby, this newly revised and updated edition of <b>Book Finds</b> reveals the secrets of locating rare and valuable books.

As an orthodox Catholic, political radical, and a rebel who courted controversy, she attracted three generations of admirers. Day went to jail challenging the draft and the war in Vietnam. She was critical of capitalism and foreign policy, and as skeptical of modern liberalism as political conservatism.<br> <br>Her protests began in 1917, leading to her arrest during the suffrage demonstration outside President Wilson&#x2019;s White House. In 1940 she spoke in Congress against the draft and urged young men not to register. She frequented jail throughout the 1950s protesting the nuclear arms race. She told audiences in 1962 that President Kennedy was as much to blame for the Cuban missile crisis. She refused to hear any criticism of the pope, though she sparred with American bishops and priests who lived in well-appointed rectories and tolerated racial segregation in their parishes.<br> <br><i>Dorothy Day </i>is the exceptional biography of a dedicated modern-day pacifist, the most outspoken advocate for the poor, and a lifelong anarchist.

And price is very important; I see it as a huge selling point that this book is cheaper than the competition."--Joel E. Mann, <em>St. Norbert's College</em><p></p><br>"As far as anthologies go, <em>Exploring Philosophy</em> is easily the best one that I've seen.

Its goal is to familiarize students with the tools they will need in order to use manifolds in mathematical or scientific research--- smooth structures, tangent vectors and covectors, vector bundles, immersed and embedded submanifolds, tensors, differential forms, de Rham cohomology, vector fields, flows, foliations, Lie derivatives, Lie groups, Lie algebras, and more. The approach is as concrete as possible, with pictures and intuitive discussions of how one should think geometrically about the abstract concepts, while making full use of the powerful tools that modern mathematics has to offer.</p><p></p><p>This second edition has been extensively revised and clarified, and the topics have been substantially rearranged. The book now introduces the two most important analytic tools, the rank theorem and the fundamental theorem on flows, much earlier so that they can be used throughout the book. A few new topics have been added, notably Sard&#x2019;s theorem and transversality, a proof that infinitesimal Lie group actions generate global group actions, a more thorough study of first-order partial differential equations, a brief treatment of degree theory for smooth maps between compact manifolds, and an introduction to contact structures.</p><p></p><p>Prerequisites include a solid acquaintance with general topology, the fundamental group, and covering spaces, as well as basic undergraduate linear algebra and real analysis.</p></p><p><p>John M. Lee is Professor of Mathematics at the University of Washington in Seattle, where he regularly teaches graduate courses on the topology and geometry of manifolds. He was the recipient of the American Mathematical Society's Centennial Research Fellowship and he is the author of four previous Springer books: the first edition (2003)&nbsp;of <i>Introduction to Smooth Manifolds</i>, the first edition (2000) and second edition (2010) of <i>Introduction to Topological Manifolds,</i> and <i>Riemannian Manifolds: An Introduction to Curvature </i>(1997).</p><p>From the reviews of the second edition:</p><p>&#x201c;It starts off with five chapters covering basics on smooth manifolds up to submersions, immersions, embeddings, and of course submanifolds. ... the book under review is laden with excellent exercises that significantly further the reader&#x2019;s understanding of the material, and Lee takes great pains to motivate everything well all the way through ... . a fine graduate-level text for differential geometers as well as people like me, fellow travelers who always wish they knew more about such a beautiful subject.&#x201d; (Michael Berg, MAA Reviews, October, 2012)</p></p><h2>The Collected Stories of Deborah Eisenberg: Stories</h2><p><p><b>Twenty-seven short stories by "a contemporary master" (<i>The New York Times</i>).</b></p><p>Since 1986 with the publication of her first story collection, Deborah Eisenberg has devoted herself to writing "exquisitely distilled stories" which "present an unusually distinctive portrait of contemporary American life" to quote the MacArthur Foundation.

It focuses on a wide range of unusual techniques, some of which depart from the more conventional methods, revealing how to portray texture by a variety of means. Ann explains how to manipulate the paint by lifting out colour, scraping and scratching the paint, and by using additional materials such as wax, clingfilm, salt and metallic pigments. She also explains how the surface itself can play an important role in the effects that can be achieved, and experiments with acrylics, inks, gouache and collage as well as watercolour.</p><p>In later chapters Ann looks at the creative process and provides insights into how to develop ideas, then concentrates on how to portray texture in specific subjects, such as flowers and foliage, animals, still life, buildings and landscapes.

Decrying the savage and unchristian treatment blacks suffered in the United States, Walker challenged his &#x201c;afflicted and slumbering brethren&#x201d; to rise up and cast off their chains. Walker worked tirelessly to circulate his book via underground networks in the South, and he was so successful that Southern lawmakers responded with new laws cracking down on &#x201c;incendiary&#x201d; antislavery material. Although Walker died in 1830, the <em>Appeal</em> remained a rallying point for African Americans for many years to come, anticipating the radicalism of later black leaders, from Malcolm X to Martin Luther King, Jr. </p><p>In this new edition of the <em>Appeal</em>, the first in over thirty years, Peter P. Hinks, the leading authority on David Walker, provides a masterly introduction and extensive annotations that incorporate the most up-to-date research on Walker, much of it first reported by Hinks in his highly acclaimed biography, <em>To Awaken My Afflicted Brethren</em>. Hinks also includes a unique appendix of documents showing the contemporary response&#x2014;from North and South, black and white&#x2014;to the <em>Appeal</em> itself and Walker&#x2019;s attempts to distribute it in the South.

To do so, Phryne takes a job within the women's magazine that employed the victim and finds herself enmeshed in her colleagues' deceptions.</p><p>But while Phryne is learning the ins and outs of magazine publishing first hand, her personal life is thrown into chaos. Impatient for her lover Lin Chung's imminent return from a silk-buying expedition to China, she instead receives an unusual summons from Lin Chung's family, followed by a series of mysterious assaults and warnings.</p></p><p><p>Kerry Greenwood was born in the Melbourne suburb of Footscray and after wandering far and wide, she returned to live there. She has degrees in English and Law from Melbourne University and was admitted to the legal profession on the 1st April 1982, a day which she finds both soothing and significant. Kerry has written three series, a number of plays, including <em>The Troubadours</em> with Stephen D'Arcy, is an award-winning children's writer and has edited and contributed to several anthologies. The Phryne Fisher series (pronounced Fry-knee, to rhyme with briny) began in 1989 with <em>Cocaine Blues</em> which was a great success. Kerry has written twenty books in this series with no sign yet of Miss Fisher hanging up her pearl-handled pistol. Kerry says that as long as people want to read them, she can keep writing them. In 2003 Kerry won the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Australian Association.</p>She smokes. She drinks. She isn't overly fond of small children. She lives with adopted daughters, assorted animals, and faithful servants. It's 1928, and the very unconventional Phryne Fisher sparkles with wit and champagne elegance. Phryne's been asked to help solve the murder of a snoopy old woman who wrote fairy stories for a magazine devoted to encouraging women to pursue nontraditional roles without actually changing anything. Meanwhile, ruthless pirates on the South China Sea have captured Phryne's lover, Lin Chung, and her Celtic blood is set to boiling. Stephanie Daniel performs with genteel ease. Her upper-class Australian accents and her wild assortment of reputable and disreputable characters are truly amazing. Kerry Greenwood's "Agatha-Christie-meets-Indiana-Jones" plotting and Daniel's energetic reading make this must listening. S.J.H.

It is not enough to understand or even relive our childhood traumas. Dr. Wolinsky shows us how we continue to recreate those traumas in our adult lives and how to stop creating them. Every uncomfortable emotional state, and many psychosomatic symptoms, are also states of trance. Trance is the &#34;glue&#34; that holds the problem in the present moment. Learning to identify the kind of trance state beneath a problem or symptom gives us the tool that finally dissolves the glue. This book offers a gold-mine of resources for those who suffer from dysfunctional patterns of behavior or for anyone who feels stuck in an undesirable emotional or addictive state. Learning to step out of the trance states that create our problems and symptoms is to learn to step into the present moment at last free of the baggage from our past.</p><p>Wolinsky&#39;s work is a true development of the brilliance of Milton Erickson.

The elements of the Roadmap are enhanced to ensure they are easier to grasp and apply. More and more leaders and their organizations are becoming convinced in the business case for creating a &#34;coaching culture&#34;. This book provides the tools for leaders and teams to develop a common language and shared protocol and a learning and development orientation towards people. These critical dynamics support the entire culture becoming a &#34;feedback-rich, high-performance&#34; organization. For this to occur, a common coaching approach driven by coaching UP, DOWN, and SIDEWAYS is necessary. Coaching flows in all directions to managers, peers, and direct reports. Coaching becomes the normal &#34;way we do things around here.&#34; The premise of &#34;The Heart of Coaching&#34; was never more true. &#34;As coaching becomes a predominant cultural practice...it will create a performance-focused, feedback-rich organization capable of creating and sustaining a competitive advantage.&#34; This &#34;Fourth Edition&#34; (available now) makes the use of the enhanced coaching model easier to use than ever, since it now includes a colorized snapout reference card. Additionally, several powerful enhancements of the Transformational Coaching methodology make it one of the most comprehensive, and systematic approaches to coaching you will find today. It guides leaders, managers, and entire teams who want to enhance or master their coaching skills through 2 critical aspects of coaching: 1. establishing authentic, healthy and respectful coaching relationships, and 2. organizing and conducting the actual coaching conversations that lead to commitments for positive results that both the coach and the coachee are willing to support.</p><p>This book is destined to make an impact on the leadership styles and cultures of the leaders who read and apply this transformational approach. It will be an invaluable investment in developing contemporary leadership competencies in leading the three different generations working side-by-side in our organizations. Connecting with people to discover what makes them &#34;tick&#34; is a rich and underdeveloped source of genuine influence and power. Transformational Coaching provides the framework for creating this deeper level of trust and mutual support.In the years I have worked with leaders and their teams to create high-performance, no leaders have been more powerful and effective with people than the ones who have decided to become a coach. Shifting both mindset and skillset from being "The Boss" to being "The Coach" is one of the most powerful transformations a leader can make as they develop their capacity to lead. <p>THE BOSS pushes people for results, THE COACH lifts people to higher level of performance; THE BOSS tells people what to do, THE COACH asks questions to see what people feel should be done; THE BOSS unwittingly triggers insecurity, THE COACH consciously triggers creativity; THE BOSS knows the answers, THE COACH seeks the answers; THE BOSS wants to achieve compliance, THE COACH inspires commitment; THE BOSS is focused only on results, THE COACH balances focus on process and performance; THE BOSS tries to get the most from people, THE COACH works to get the best from people.</p></p><h2>A Time to Be Born</h2><p>Set against an atmospheric backdrop of New York City in the months just before America&#x2019; s entry into World War II, <i>A Time To Be Born</i> is a scathing and hilarious study of cynical New Yorkers stalking each other for various selfish ends. At the center of the story are a wealthy, self-involved newspaper publisher and his scheming, novelist wife, Amanda Keeler. Powell always denied that Amanda Keeler was based upon the real-life Clare Boothe Luce, until years later when she discovered a memo she&#x2019;d written to herself in 1939 that said, &#x201c;Why not do a novel on Clare Luce?&#x201d; Which prompted Powell to write in her diary &#x201c;Who can I believe? Me or myself?&#x201d;</p><p>When Dawn Powell died in 1965, virtually all her books were out of print. Not a single historical survey of American literature mentioned her, even in passing. And so she slept, seemingly destined to be forgotten &#x2013; or, to put it more exactly, never to be remembered.&nbsp;<br><br>How things have changed! Numerous novels by Dawn Powell are currently available, along with her diaries and short stories. She has joined the Library of America, admitted to the illustrious company of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Adams, Frederick Douglass, and Edith Wharton. She is taught in college and read with delight on vacation. For the contemporary poet and novelist Lisa Zeidner, writing in<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>, Powell &#x201c;is wittier than Dorothy Parker, dissects the rich better than F. Scott Fitzgerald, is more plaintive than Willa Cather in her evocation of the heartland, and has a more supple control of satirical voice than Evelyn Waugh.&#x201d; For his part, Gore Vidal offered a simple reason for Powell&#x2019;s sudden popularity in the early Twentieth Century: &#x201c;We are catching up to her.&#x201d;<br><br>Dawn Powell was born in Mt. Gilead, Ohio, on November 28, 1896, the second of three daughters. Her father was a traveling salesman, and her mother died a few days after Dawn turned seven. After enduring great cruelty at the hands of her stepmother, Dawn ran away at the age of thirteen and eventually arrived at the home of her maternal aunt, who served hot meals to travelers emerging from the train station across the street. Dawn worked her way through college and made it to New York. There she married a young advertising executive and had one child, a boy who suffered from autism, then an unknown condition.<br><br>Powell referred to herself as a &#x201c;permanent visitor&#x201d; in her adopted Manhattan and brought to her writing a perspective gained from her upbringing in Middle America. She knew many of the great writers of her time, and Diana Trilling famously said it was Dawn &#x201c;who really says the funny things for which Dorothy Parker gets credit.&#x201d; Ernest Hemingway called her his &#x201c;favorite living writer.&#x201d; She was one of America&#x2019; s great novelists, and yet when she died in 1965 she was buried in an unmarked grave in New York&#x2019;s Potter&#x2019;s Field.Here's one to savor when you're feeling sour--a reissue of a 1942 novel teeming with egregiously opportunistic, social-climbing Manhattanites who see WW II as just one more cause to manipulate and who are appalled not by Hitler's barbarism but by his mean birth and bad manners. The narcissistic queen bitch of the hour (who Gore Vidal purports is modeled casually on Clare Boothe Luce) is Amanda Keeler Evans: she snatches a newspaper baron from his wife; achieves monumental success as a romance novelist after hubby's papers print rave reviews of the ghost-written book; and, subsequently, pontificates on politics without expertise but to great acclaim. Amanda even finds a way to use newly arrived Vicky Haven, an old chum from her anonymous Ohio past. Unbeknownst to Vicky, she's to serve as beard for Amanda's affair with Ken Saunders, an old beau whom Amanda doesn't love but whom she keeps on a leash to bolster her ego. But sparks ignite between beard and beau, the egotistical newspaper baron seeks revenge against an unfaithful wife and Amanda's empire threatens to fold like a house of cards. Period details are keen (in Vicky's apartment house: "At each landing was the conventional old-time niche designed for easing the passage of coffins up and down stairs"), and Powell's ( The Golden Spur ) spoof of the high and mighty still sizzles half a century after it was written. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>To Win Her Heart</h2><p><b>Do They Have a Fighting Chance at Love?<br><br></b>After completing his sentence for the unintentional crime that derailed his youthful plans for fame and fortune, Levi Grant looks to start over in the town of Spencer, Texas.

The translation is fluid and faithful, while the introductory materials lucidly contextualize Marie&#x2019;s <em>Lais</em> both in their own cultural moment and in contemporary scholarship.

Her historical novels have charmed and delighted millions of readers for decades, though she rarely reached out to the public to discuss her works or private life. It is known that she was born in Wimbledon in August 1902, and her first novel, The Black Moth, was published in 1921. <br><br>Heyer published 56 books over the next 53 years, until her death from lung cancer in 1974.

All was bustle and confusion; and for a few minutes Miss Malvern, climbing down from the coach, was bewildered by it, and stood looking round her rather helplessly. Until the guard dumped at her feet the small corded trunk which contained her worldly possessions and advised her to look sharp to it, no one paid the least attention to her, except an ostler leading out two horses, and adjuring her to get out of the way, and one of the inevitable street-vendors who haunted busy inn-yards, begging her to buy some gingerbread. The guard, assailed by demands from several anxious travellers to have their bags and bandboxes restored to them immediately, had little time to spare, but Miss Malvern's flower-like countenance, and her air of youthful innocence, impelled him to ask her if anyone was meeting her. When she shook her head, he clicked his tongue disapprovingly, and expressed a hope that she might at least know where she was a-going to.</p> <p>A gleam of amusement lightened the shadows in Miss Malvern's large gray eyes; she replied, with a tiny chuckle: &#x2018;Oh, yes! I do know that!'</p> <p>&#x2018;What you want, missy, is a hack!' said the guard.</p> <p>&#x2018;No, I don't: I want a porter!' said Miss Malvern, speaking with unexpected decision.</p> <p>The guard seemed to be inclined to argue this point, but as a stout lady was tugging at his coat-tails, shrilly demanding to know what he had done with a basket of fish consigned to his care, he was obliged to abandon Miss Malvern to her fate, merely shouting in stentorian accents for a porter to carry the young lady's trunk.</p> <p>This summons was responded to by a burly individual in a frieze coat, who undertook, for the sum of sixpence, to carry Miss Malvern's trunk to the warehouse of Josiah Nidd &amp; Son, Carriers. Since this establishment was situated a bare quarter of a mile from the Bull and Mouth, Miss Malvern had a shrewd suspicion that she was being grossly overcharged; but although an adventurous youth spent in following the drum had accustomed her to haggling with Portuguese farmers and Spanish muleteers, she did not feel inclined to embark on argument in a crowded London inn-yard, so she agreed the price, and desired the porter to lead her to the warehouse.</p> <p>The premises acquired some years earlier by Mr Nidd and his son had originally been an inn, of neither the size nor the quality of the Bull and Mouth, but, like it, provided with a galleried yard, and a number of stables and coach-houses. Occupying a large part of the yard was an enormous wagon mounted on nine-inch cylindrical wheels, and covered by a spreading tilt. Three brawny lads were engaged in loading this vehicle with a collection of goods ranging from pack-cases to farm-implements, their activities being directed, and shrilly criticized, by an aged gentleman, who was seated on the balcony on one side of the yard. Beneath this balcony a glass door had once invited entrance to the coffee-room, but this had been replaced by a green-painted wooden door, flanked by tubs filled with geraniums, and furnished with a bright brass knocker, indicating that the erstwhile hostelry had become a private residence. Picking her way between the piles of packages, and directing the porter to follow her, Miss Malvern went to it, lifting its latch without ceremony, and stepping into a narrow passage, from which a door gave access into the old coffee-room, and a flight of uneven stairs rose to the upper floors. The trunk set down, and the porter dismissed, Miss Malvern heaved a sigh of relief, as of one who had accomplished an enterprise fraught with peril, and called: &#x2018;Sarah?'</p> <p>No immediate response being forthcoming, she called again, more loudly, and moved to the foot of the stairs. But even as she set her foot on the bottom step, a door at the end of the passage burst open, and a lady in a flowered print dress, with an old-fashioned tucker round her ample bosom, and a starched muslin cap tied in a bow beneath her chin, stood as though stunned on the threshold, and gasped: &#x2018;Miss Kate! It's never you! Oh, my dearie, my precious lambkin!'</p> <p>She started forward, holding out her plump arms, and Miss Malvern, laughing and crying, tumbled into them, hugging her, and uttering disjointedly: &#x2018;Oh, Sarah, oh, Sarah! To be with you again! I've been thinking of nothing else, all the way! Oh, Sarah, I'm so tired, and dispirited, and there was nowhere else for me to go, but indeed I don't mean to impose on you, or on poor Mr Nidd! Only until I can find another situation!'</p> <p>Several teardrops stood on Mrs Nidd's cheeks, but she said in a scolding voice: &#x2018;Now, that's no way to talk, Miss Kate, and well you know it! And where else should you go, I should like to know? Now, you come into the kitchen, like a good girl, while I pop the kettle on, and cut some bread-and-butter!'</p> <p>Miss Malvern dried her eyes, and sighed: &#x2018;Oh, dear, would you have believed I could be so ticklish? It was such a horrid journey six of us inside! and no time to swallow more than a sip of coffee when we stopped for breakfast.'</p> <p>Mrs Nidd, leading her into the kitchen, and thrusting her into a chair, demanded: &#x2018;Are you telling me you came on the common stage, Miss Kate?'</p> <p>&#x2018;Yes, of course I did. Well, you couldn't expect them to have sent me by post, could you? And if you're thinking of the Mail, I am excessively glad they didn't send me by that either, because it reached London just after four o'clock in the morning! What should I have done?'</p> <p>&#x2018;You'd have come round here straight! For goodness' sake, dearie, what's happened to bring you back in such a bang, with never a word to me, so as I could have met you?'</p> <p>&#x2018;There was no time,' explained Kate. &#x2018;Besides, I couldn't have got a frank, and why should you be obliged to pay for a letter when you were going to see me immediately? I've been turned off, Sarah.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Turned off?' repeated Mrs Nidd terribly.</p> <p>&#x2018;Yes, but not without a character,' said Kate, with an irrepressible twinkle. &#x2018;At least, Mrs Grittleton wouldn't have given me one, but Mr Astley assured me his wife would, and was very sorry to lose me. Which, indeed, I expect she is, because we dealt very well together, and I did make the children mind me.'</p> <p>&#x2018;And who, pray, may this Mrs Grittleton be?' said Mrs Nidd, pausing in the act of measuring tea-leaves into a large pot.</p> <p>&#x2018;A griffin,' replied Kate.</p> <p>&#x2018;I'd griffin her! But who is she, love? And what had she to say to anything?'</p> <p>&#x2018;She is Mrs Astley's mother. She had everything to say, I promise you! She took me in dislike the moment she saw me. She said I was too young to have charge of her grandchildren, and she told poor Mrs Astley that I had insinuating manners! Oh, yes, and that I was sly, and designing! That was because her detestable son tried to kiss me, and I slapped his face. Though why she should have thought that was being designing I can't conceive! Oh, Sarah, you never saw such a moon-calf! He is as silly as his sister, and not by half as agreeable! She may be a wet-goose which, indeed, she is! but the most amiable creature! And as for my being too young to have the charge of the children, she was a great deal too young to have three children! Why, she's no more than three years older than I am, Sarah, and such a featherhead! And now she has miscarried of a fourth child, and Mrs Grittleton set it at my door! And, I must say, I thought it pretty poor-spirited of Mr Astley not to have turned her out of the house, because he told me she never came to stay with them but to make trouble, and as for young Grittleton ' She broke off, with a gurgle of laughter. &#x2018;The things he said about him, Sarah! I couldn't but laugh! And the odious creature's intentions were most honourable! He made me an offer! That, of course, was what threw Mrs Grittleton into such a pelter, for, try as I would, I couldn't make her believe that nothing could prevail upon me to marry her detestable son. She ranted like an archwife, and scolded poor Mrs Astley into such a pucker that she fell into strong convulsions, and miscarried. So Mr Astley saw nothing for it but to send me away. I own, he behaved very handsomely, for he paid me for the whole year not merely the six months I had truly earned! and sent me to the coach-stop in his own carriage; but, considering he told me himself that he held me blameless, I can't but think it was very poor-spirited of him not to have sent Mrs Grittleton packing instead of me!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Poor-spirited?' ejaculated Mrs Nidd, removing the lid from one of the pots on the fire, and viciously stirring its contents, &#x2018;ay, and so you may, and so they are all of 'em! Anything for peace and quiet, that's men!' She replaced the lid on the pot, and turned to look down at her nursling, trouble in her face. &#x2018;I'm not saying you should have accepted that young Grittleton's offer, but oh, dearie me, what's to be done now?'</p> <p>&#x2018;I must find myself another situation, of course,' responded Kate. &#x2018;I mean to visit the registry office this very day. Only ' She paused, eyeing Mrs Nidd uncertainly.</p> <p>&#x2018;Only what?' demanded that lady.</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, I have been thinking, Sarah, and, although I know you won't agree with me, I believe I should be very well advised to seek a situation in in a domestic capacity.'</p> <p>&#x2018;In a Never while I'm alive!' said Mrs Nidd. &#x2018;The lord knows it went against the pluck with me when you hired yourself out as a governess, but at least it was genteel! But if you're thinking of going out as a cook-maid, or '</p> <p>&#x2018;I shouldn't think anyone who wasn't all about in her head would hire me!' interrupted Kate, laughing. &#x2018;You know I can't bake an egg without burning it! No, I believe I might do very well or, at any rate, tolerably well! as an abigail! In fact, I daresay I could rise to be a dresser! Then, you know, I should be a person of huge consequence, besides making my fortune. Mrs Astley's housekeeper has a cousin who is dresser to a lady of fashion, and you wouldn't believe how plump in the pocket she is!'</p> <p>&#x2018;No, I wouldn't!' retorted Mrs Nidd. &#x2018;And even if I did '</p> <p>&#x2018;But it is perfectly true!' insisted Kate. &#x2018;For one thing, a first-rate dresser commands a far bigger wage than a mere governess besides being a person of very much more consequence! Unless, of course, the governess should be excessively well-educated, and able to instruct her charges in all the genteel accomplishments. And even then, you know, nobody slides sovereigns or bills into her hand to win her favour!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, upon my word !' uttered Mrs Nidd explosively.</p> <p>Kate's eyes danced. &#x2018;Yes, isn't it shocking? But beggars can't be choosers, and I've made up my mind to it that to make my fortune or, at any rate, to win an independence! is of more importance than to preserve my gentility. No, no, listen, Sarah! You must know that I have no accomplishments. I can't speak Italian, or play the piano far less the harp! and even if people wished their children to be instructed in Spanish, which they don't, I don't think they would wish them to learn soldiers' Spanish, which is all I know! On the other hand, I can sew, and make, and dress a head to admiration! I did so once for Mrs Astley, when she was going to a ball, and her woman had made a perfect botch of her hair. So '</p> <p>&#x2018;No!' said Mrs Nidd, in a tone which brooked no argument. &#x2018;Now, you drink your tea, and eat your nice bread-and-butter, and no more nonsense! If ever I listened to such a pack of skimble-skamble stuff ! And I don't want to hear any more about imposing on me and Nidd, for there's no question of that, and I take it unkindly of you to say such a thing, Miss Kate!'</p> <p>Kate caught her hand, and nursed it to her cheek. &#x2018;No, no, Sarah! You know better! How infamous it would be if I were to foist myself on to you! When I think of all you have to do, with old Mr Nidd living here, and all those grandsons of his to feed, and house, I feel it's quite shameless of me to come to you even for a short visit! I couldn't stay here for ever, dear, dearest Sarah! You must own I could not!'</p> <p>&#x2018;No, you couldn't,' acknowledged Mrs Nidd. &#x2018;It wouldn't be fitting. Not but what there's only three grandsons, and one of them lives with his ma that's Joe's sister Maggie, and the most gormless creature you ever did see! Still, there's no harm in her, and I'm bound to say she's always ready to come and lend me a bit of help if help you can call it! But a carrier's yard is no place for you, dearie, and well do I know it! We'll think of something, never you fear!'</p> <p>&#x2018;I have thought of something!' murmured Kate wickedly.</p> <p>&#x2018;No, you haven't, Miss Kate. You're puckered, with that nasty stage-coach, and all the uproar that was kicked up by that Mrs Brimstone, or whatever she calls herself, and you'll feel different when I've got you tucked into bed, which I'm going to do the minute you've drunk up your tea. You'll have your sleep out, and when you wake up you shall have your dinner in the parlour upstairs, and we'll see what's to be done.'</p> <p>Kate sighed. &#x2018;I am very tired,' she confessed, &#x2018;but I shall be happy to eat my dinner downstairs, with the rest of you. I don't wish '</p> <p>&#x2018;An ox-cheek, with dumplings!' interrupted Mrs Nidd. &#x2018;I daresay! But it ain't what I wish, Miss Kate, and nor it isn't what Nidd or the boys would wish neither, for to be sitting down to their dinner in company with a young lady like yourself would put them into such a stew, minding their manners and that, as would turn them clean against their vittles! So you'll just do as Sarah tells you, dearie, and '</p> <p>&#x2018;Believe that Sarah knows best!' supplied Kate, submitting.</p> <p>&#x2018;Which you can be bound I do!' said Mrs Nidd.</p> <p>Miss Malvern was neither so young nor so guileless as her flower-like countenance frequently led strangers to suppose. She was four-and-twenty years old, and her life had not been passed in a sheltered schoolroom. The sole offspring of a clandestine marriage between the charming but sadly unsatisfactory scion of a distinguished family and a romantic girl of great beauty but somewhat inferior lineage, she was born in a garrison-town, and reared in a succession of lodgings and billets. The runaway bride whom Captain Malvern had captivated disappointed her scandalized relations by suffering no regret whatsoever at being repudiated by them; and falsified their expectations by remaining so ridiculously besotted that neither the discomforts of following the drum, nor the aberrations of her volatile spouse abated her love, or daunted her spirits. She brought Kate up in the belief that Papa was the personification of every virtue (the embarrassing situations in which from time to time he found himself arising not from any obliquity but from an excess of amiability), and that it was the duty of his wife and daughter to cherish him. She died, in Portugal, when Kate was twelve years old, almost with her last breath adjuring Kate to take good care of Papa, and, to the best of her ability, Kate had done so, aided and abetted by her redoubtable nurse. Sarah cherished no illusions, but, like nearly all who were acquainted with him, she was a victim of his compelling charm. &#x2018;Poor dear gentleman!' Sarah had said, after his funeral. &#x2018;He had his faults, like the best of us not that I'm saying he was the best, because telling faradiddles...</p></p><h2>Outcast</h2><p><p><b>From author Rosemary Sutcliff, author of the classic tale <i>The Eagle of the Ninth, </i>comes <i>Outcast</i>, the tale of an orphan boy in the ancient world. </b></p><p>When a Roman ship is wrecked off the coast of Britain, an infant, Beric, is the only survivor, saved by members of a British tribe.

In the house-place of Cunori, the Chieftain's brother, the hearth-smoke came billowing back in stinging clouds from the smoke-hole in the low turf roof, and the seal-oil lamp hanging from the roof-tree leapt and fluttered and sank, bringing the shadows crowding in, so that for a moment the storm and the things of the storm seemed to have broken through into the small round stronghold of warmth and safety that was Cunori's home. But the gust passed, as the others had done, and the lamp steadied, and the side-driven flames leapt up again on the hearth. Cunori, sitting beside the fire, listened to the gale beating its wild wings all round the house-place, and was glad that the lambing was over and he need not go out again to-night. He leaned forward to catch the light on the spearhead to which he was fitting a new shaft. The old shaft, notched and splintered and warped from many hunts, lay beside him; and the new ashen shaft was satisfyingly white and straight as he fitted it into the socket; and the long, slender head caught the leaping firelight, so that it was like a tongue of flame between his hands. Three hounds lay a-sprawl on the rushes, with their bellies to the warmth: huge, brindled, wolf-seeming creatures. And on the far side of the fire--the Women's Side --Guinear sat spinning. Cunori glanced at her from time to time as he worked, but she never raised her eyes from the whirling spindle with its growing spool of greyish wool. He wished that she wouldlook up; he wished that she would stop spinning for a moment; he wished he could think of something to say that would make her laugh. He liked it when she laughed. That was one of the reasons why he had asked her of her father, two summers ago: so that he could have her laughter by his own fire. But she had not laughed for half a moon now--not since the babe died. Cunori was sorry about the babe, though not so sorry as he would have been if it had been a son. Daughters could be set to help in the field-strips and so on, but almost as soon as they were large enough to be any use you had the trouble of getting them married, and once they were married, you might as well have never had daughters at all--better, indeed, because you had to give some of your own weapons to whoever it was who married them, to seal the bargain. Sons were quite another matter: they went with you on the hunting trail, and they brought their wives home to work on the family field-strips, and when you were too old to hunt, they hunted for you. When you had enough sons, it might be good to have daughters; a daughter before you had any sons at all was really something of a misfortune. But he knew that it did not seem like that to Guinear; all Guinear cared for was that it had been hers, and that it had lived only a day. 'If the harvest is good, I will give her a set of amber pins for her hair,' he thought, laying down the wolf-spear and taking up another that was in need of burnishing. 'And some cooking-pots; and if the harvest is very good, I will give her a length of fine striped cloth such as the merchants sell, to make a tunic.' But he knew that the amber pins and the cooking-pots and even the fine striped cloth would not comfort Guinear for the loss of the babe; and that made him feel helpless, and feeling helpless was a thing that always made him angry; so he scowled at the spear-blade, rubbing harder and harder, as though he hated it. The gale seemed to be rising higher than ever, and under the beating and howling of it a new note was swelling, nowlost beneath the shriller overtones of the storm, now sounding clear: the deep, reverberating boom and crash that was the sea. The wind was going round to the north, piling the seas on to the black rocks of the headland, flinging in wave after wave like the blows of a hammer, as though to batter the cliffs to pulp. He looked up with a start, and even Guinear checked her spinning, as a gust wilder than any that had gone before hurled itself upon the house-place with a drumming that shook the very roof-tree. Luath, the pack leader, opened eyes like twin yellow lamps in the wildly flickering gloom, and growled softly in his throat, then sprang up, followed by the rest, their hair rising along their necks, as the leather apron over the low, shielded entrance was plucked aside, and a figure came ducking in with the eddying gale behind it. Cunori was afoot as swiftly as his hounds, grasping his hunting-spear in one hand while with the other he made the sign to avert evil. But the new-comer was neither live enemy nor storm-driven ghost, though from his appearance he might have been either; and as he came into the leaping flame-light, the great hounds ceased their sing-song snarling and lay down again, and Cunori tossed aside his spear. 'Flann!' he cried disgustedly. 'You were never nearer to a spear between your ribs ! What brings you abroad on such a night?' Flann was gasping for breath as he stood before the entrance, shaking the wild hair out of his eyes. 'The red mare, in the first place,' he panted. She broke out again, and I have been right away over the sea-cliffs after her, and it was so that I saw it. There's a ship caught in the bay and trying to beat out round the headland. She will be on to the Killer Rock by now!' Cunori's disgust was gone on the instant. He remembered the last time a ship had driven on to the Killer. There had been many things washed up by the sea afterwards. He said nothing, but his eyes met Flann's, and a fierce excitement leapt between them. Then, swinging round on the woman,who had risen also, he demanded: 'My cloak! Quick! Bring me my cloak, Guinear.' Flann had already disappeared again, to spread the news throughout the village, as she brought it to him. He caught it from her and flung it round his shoulders, stabbing home the bronze pin, and plunged out after Flann into the buffeting darkness, thrusting back the hounds who made to follow him. The wind almost took his breath away as he made his way down between the crowding huts to the gate of the stockade. Clearly he had not been the first to whom Flann had cried his news, for other dark figures were heading in the same direction, and when they reached it they found the thorn bush which normally blocked the gap at night had already been dragged aside by those who had gone before. They left it so, for those who came after them, and turned seaward, heads down and shoulders hunched, leaning into the wind. The moon, which was near to full, seemed racing across the night, now lost behind great banks of tattered cloud, now sailing out into ragged fjords of clear sky; and as it came and went, the tribesmen were now engulfed in bat-winged darkness, now flooded with swift silver radiance, as they struggled seaward. The whole Men's Side of the village was out and heading for the coast and the promised wreck, streaming out hound-wise across the hills, eager for whatever harvest Camulus the Lord of Storms had sent their way. And among the rest, Cunori came at last over what seemed to be the edge of the world into the full onslaught of the shrieking gale and the salt taste of spindrift on his lips; and crouching against the thrust of the wind that strove to pluck him off and whirl him away like a blown leaf, looked down. From where he stood the cliff fell away in a gigantic tumble of turf-slopes and granite ledges, ending in the jagged thrust of rocks round which the water boiled in yeasty turmoil, whose farthest rock of all, lying hidden beneath the water save at low tide, was the Killer. And out on the Killer, caught and battered and already breaking up, was the ship that Flann had seen. The moon, riding clear of the clouds at that moment, showed her clearly: a mastless, broken-backed thing that had once been a Roman merchantman. The watching tribesmen on the cliff-top had seen many such--transports and galleys, too--plying up and down to the great Legionary Station of Isca Silurium. Sometimes it happened, in a north-easterly wind, that a vessel would get embayed somewhere along the coast and be driven on to the rocks, and when that happened there were seldom any of the crew left to tell the tale; but afterwards their cargoes and their gear came ashore along with their drowned bodies. Cunori held back the hair that whipped across his face, and gazed out towards the wreck, wondering how long she would hold together. Not long, he thought, not long in this sea; and he spared a moment to think that it would not be good to be in that ship now, before he plunged on down the narrow, swerving cliff-track to the sea. Half-way down he all but fell over a squatting figure, and realized that it was Merddyn the Druid, Merddyn the old and crazy, who had once been powerful. The old man was crouching in the shelter of an outcropping rock, crooning to himself and swaying to and fro as he watched the scene below him. He looked up as Cunori halted an instant beside him, and laughed, with a high, inhuman, seabird note in his laughter. See there!' he cried above the wind. 'See down there! A fine sight--a sight to warm the hands at as though it were a fire! Aiee! That was a great wave! Right over them! Another as great, and there will be one ship's crew the fewer of the Eagle People, to strut in the sun! One more wave. Oh, wave and king among waves, great white-maned, stallion-crested wave, come swiftly and trample with your hooves and make an end, that the old heart of Merddyn the Druid may rejoice!' Cunori left him and went on down the steep track, crouching against the wind. Below him the great waves thundered in, pounding upon the rocks, pounding upon the doomed ship; but indeed it was no ship now, only a pitiful broken thing thatgrew smaller with every wave. On a level patch a little above the foot of the cliff the tribesmen were gathering. From here a man might almost have hurled a spear into the wreck; but the moon was dimming into the clouds again, and through the flung spray and turmoil of the storm they could see no sign of any life on board, nor hear any cry. There was nothing that the tribesmen could do to help, and even if there had been, they would scarcely have thought to try. To take from the sea was unlucky. If any man got ashore living, that was another matter; they would give him food and shelter, tend his hurts, and send him on his way. But from this wreck, in this sea, no man would get ashore living. Rhythmically, remorselessly, the great waves came in, hurling against the rocks and breaking with a booming thunder that made the solid ground shudder under Cunori's feet. He was drenched with spray, dazed and stunned by the sheer stupendous tumult of wind and sea. The dimmed moon was brightening again, and by its light he saw, through the curtain of flying spume, the dark shape of the wreck; and even as he looked, a huge curled and crested wave reared up, arching over it: the great wave that Merddyn had called for. It broke with a crash that seemed to shake earth and sky, plunging and pouring down. Black reef and black wreck were engulfed in it, hidden in a boiling turmoil from which the spray burst upward in a spreading sheet and was whipped away by the wind. And when it cleared, the white water was sluicing down the crannies of the reef, boiling over the hidden Killer; and of the wreck there was no sign. Even as the tribesmen watched, a great, silver-fringed cloud swept across the moon, and the world was quenched in darkness. &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> The gale, as though it had accomplished its purpose, began to abate from that moment, and it was in a spent grey dawn that the tribesmen went searching among the rocks along the Seal Strand a little back from the headland for the things that the storm had brought them. A high grey sky, veined with blue and silver, arched above a gale-swept world, and the dying wind had gone round, so that in the lee of the cliffs it was almost still. But the great combers came rolling in in white unbroken ranks to crash and cream among the rocks and on the little shingle beaches. The tide was out, leaving the narrow beaches littered with the things that had come ashore already from the wreck: spars and timber and cordage that would all come in useful; a few carcasses of sheep; wineskins that came rolling in, and were gathered by men who made human chains and waded out to meet them; drowned seamen who must presently be given burial, lest their wet ghosts come dripping to the hearths of the village. With the next two tides there would be more, more of everything, all along the bay. No more after that. Cunori, searching under the headland, with a mass of dripping cordage under one arm, was the first to find two bodies among the rocks. Most of those they had found so far had been seamen, but these were of a different kind. They were a man and a woman, held close in each other's arms with a clasp so strong that not even the rocks had been able to break it. They were both young. The man looked as though he were a soldier--a look which Cunori, himself a warrior, recognized: maybe a soldier going to join his Legion. The woman's long, wet hair, outflung across the rock, and trailing among the grey and olive sea-wrack, was golden brown. Lovely it must have been when it was dry, Cunori thought. He bent to look at the two more closely, and as he did so, something stirred between them. With a startled exclamation, he drew back; then stooped closer, to investigate. He found a wonder; one thing that had come alive out of that raging sea. Tightly lashed with what looked like strips torn from a cloak, into the hollow of the man's shoulder, was a very young baby. It was the rocks, Cunori thought, rather than the sea, that had killed its mother and father, and their bodies had shielded the babe. Now it stirred, making a tiny, sick, crowing sound as it tried to breathe. It was blue, andhalf drowned: quite soon, if it were left to itself, it would be dead, too. And for a moment Cunori hesitated. It would be much less trouble to leave it there. Then, hardly knowing why, he took his hunting-knife from his belt and cut the strips of cloth that held it to its father, and lifted it clear. It was a man child, not more than four or five moons old, and it was quite unhurt. 'I must get the water out of this thing, or it will die,' Cunori thought, and he held it upside down and shook it. A little salt water came out of its mouth, and he went on shaking it. Suddenly it began to wail: a thin, bleating cry like that of a new-born lamb, but desperately weak. Cunori turned it right end up and looked at it in wonder, feeling the tiny life of it fluttering and fighting for existence between his hands; then with a hurried and almost shame-faced gesture bundled it into the folds of his wet cloak and stowed it in the crook of his arm against what little warmth there was in his own chilled body. Food, he thought; he must get it to food and warmth quickly, or that fighting spark of life in it would go out. He cast one last uncertain look at the man and the woman. He did not think that they could have had any thought of saving the babe--not in such a sea and such a coast: they must have meant only that the three of them should be together. But they <i>had</i> saved the babe; and Cunori wanted it. He wanted it for Guinear, because it might comfort her better than amber pins or a new cooking-pot could do. Holding it close against him, he turned to go. He found himself face to face with Merddyn the Druid, and checked, startled. It was never pleasant to find Merddyn close to one unexpectedly; his eyes were yellow, cold and bright and hard as jewe...</p><h2>Beowulf: A Prose Translation (Penguin Classics)paperback</h2><p><b>The greatest surviving Old English poem rendered into modern prose<br><br>Beowulf</b> stands at the head of English literature; a poem of historical interest and epic scope.

Taken together, they are the culmination of more than fifty years of reflection on liberalism and on some of the most pressing problems of our times by John Rawls.</p><p>&#x201c;The Law of Peoples&#x201d; extends the idea of a social contract to the Society of Peoples and lays out the general principles that can and should be accepted by both liberal and non-liberal societies as the standard for regulating their behavior toward one another. In particular, it draws a crucial distinction between basic human rights and the rights of each citizen of a liberal constitutional democracy. It explores the terms under which such a society may appropriately wage war against an &#x201c;outlaw society&#x201d; and discusses the moral grounds for rendering assistance to non-liberal societies burdened by unfavorable political and economic conditions.</p><p>&#x201c;The Idea of Public Reason Revisited&#x201d; explains why the constraints of public reason, a concept first discussed in <i>Political Liberalism</i> (1993), are ones that holders of both religious and non-religious comprehensive views can reasonably endorse. It is Rawls&#x2019;s most detailed account of how a modern constitutional democracy, based on a liberal political conception, could and would be viewed as legitimate by reasonable citizens who on religious, philosophical, or moral grounds do not themselves accept a liberal comprehensive doctrine&#x2015;such as that of Kant, or Mill, or Rawls&#x2019;s own &#x201c;Justice as Fairness,&#x201d; presented in <i>A Theory of Justice</i> (1971).</p></p><p>John Rawls was James Bryant Conant University Professor at Harvard University. He was recipient of the 1999 National Humanities Medal.&#x201c;[These essays are] some of [Rawls&#x2019;s] strongest published expressions of feeling... These are the final products of a remarkably pure and concentrated career... The writings of John Rawls, whom it is now safe to describe as the most important political philosopher of the twentieth century...owe their influence to the fact that their depth and their insight repay the close attention that their uncompromising theoretical weight and erudition demand.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Thomas Nagel</b><b>, </b><b><i>New Republic</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Rawls offers us the appealing vision of a social order that every citizen finds legitimate despite large differences in their personal values. In <i>The Law of Peoples</i>, he attempts a parallel feat for global society. He tries to spell out a Law of Peoples that both liberal and non-liberal peoples can agree upon to govern their international relations. This involves steering a judicious mid-course between liberalism&#x2019;s imperialist and isolationist tendencies... I should say straight away that this is the most engaging and accessible book Rawls has written. Although some of the daunting conceptual apparatus from <i>Political Liberalism</i> appears from time to time, for the most part Rawls lays out his argument in a straightforward way, and refers extensively to historical and contemporary episodes to illustrate it.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>David Miller</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;John Rawls is one of the great political philosophers of the 20th century... His ideas have not only sparked a lively debate among philosophers, which continues to this day, but they have also been taken up by economists, sociologists and others. So <i>The Law of Peoples</i>, Mr. Rawls&#x2019;s latest work and probably his last significant effort, deserves to be read with interest, and some respect.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>The Economist</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Now, in an effort to turn realpolitik on its big, bald head, Rawls in <i>The Law of Peoples</i> proposes to extend his historicist, pragmatic notions of justice to the larger world of &#x2018;peoples&#x2019;&#x2015;the term he prefers to &#x2018;nations.&#x2019; He lays out a series of general principles&#x2015;among them, that peoples are free and independent, should honor human rights, and should observe a duty of nonintervention&#x2015;that can and should be accepted as a standard for regulating their behavior toward one another. Without the slightest hint of millenarian fever, he goes so far as to assert that we stand on the brink of a &#x2018;realistic utopia&#x2019;... <i>The Law of Peoples</i> seems likely to reframe the debate about what is possible in the international realm.

This great wolf is just one of the animals whose true stories come to life in this engrossing collection of tales by the celebrated naturalist Ernest Thompson Seton (1860&#x2013;1946). Combining scientific observations of animals in their natural habitats with a romantic vision of nature and the narrative skills of a born storyteller, Seton created an extraordinary collection of tales that gave the animal story new force and believability as a literary genre. Critically and popularly acclaimed upon its initial appearance in 1898, <i>Wild Animals I Have Known</i> remains, a century later, the best-known and best-loved of his works. <br>Each tale focuses on an individual creature: the clever crow, Silverspot; Raggylug, a young cottontail rabbit; the author's errant hound, Bingo; Redruff, a Don Valley partridge; a wild horse known as The Mustang; Vixen, The Springfield Fox; and Willy, faithful sheep-dog by day and treacherous killer by night. Seton offers affectionate but realistic portraits of each animal, stressing the commonality between his subjects and their human neighbors.<br>In addition to his popular wildlife stories, the author is well known for his work as an illustrator and painter. This edition faithfully reproduces the layout of the original volume, as well as all 200 of the author's distinctive illustrations. Animal lovers, environmentalists, naturalists, and any reader who appreciates a lively yarn will cherish this memorable wildlife classic.</p><p>Ernest Thompson Seton was born in South Shields, Durham, England, in 1860. His family emigrated to Canada in 1866 and settled near Lindsay, Ontario. Four years later they moved to Toronto, where Seton received his early education. He graduated from the Ontario College of Art in 1879 and pursued further studies at the Royal Academy in England, and at l'Acad�mie Julian in Paris.<br><br>Seton returned to Canada in 1881 and joined his brother on a homestead near Carberry, Manitoba. There he made extensive notes on the behaviour of animals and birds, complementing his studies as a naturalist with commissioned work as an illustrator and painter.<br><br>His first collection of animal stories, <b>Wild Animals I Have Known</b> (1898), won immediate critical and popular acclaim, and was followed in the next four decades by more than thirty volumes of such fiction.<br>Seton founded a youth organization, the League of Woodcraft Indians, and in 1910 joined Lord Baden-Powell in establishing the Boy Scouts of America. In the same year, he wrote the <b>Boy Scouts of America Official Manual</b>.<br><br>In 1930 Seton moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he set up Seton Village, a centre for environmentalists, naturalists, and students of North American Indian culture.<br><br>Ernest Thompson Seton died in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 1946.<b>Lobo</b><br><b>The King of Currumpaw</b><br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>I<br>&nbsp;<br>Currumpaw is a vast cattle range in northern New Mexico. It is a land of rich pastures and teeming flocks and herds, a land of rolling mesas and precious running waters that at length unite in the Currumpaw River, from which the whole region is named. And the king whose despotic power was felt over its entire extent was an old gray wolf.<br>&nbsp;<br>Old Lobo, or the king, as the Mexicans called him, was the gigantic leader of a remarkable pack of gray wolves, that had ravaged the Currumpaw Valley for a number of years. All the shepherds and ranchmen knew him well, and, wherever he appeared with his trusty band, terror reigned supreme among the cattle, and wrath and despair among their owners. Old Lobo was a giant among wolves, and was cunning and strong in proportion to his size. His voice at night was well-known and easily distinguished from that of any of his fellows. An ordinary wolf might howl half the night about the herdsman's bivouac without attracting more than a passing notice, but when the deep roar of the old king came booming down the ca�on, the watcher bestirred himself and prepared to learn in the morning that fresh and serious inroads had been made among the herds.<br>&nbsp;<br>Old Lobo's band was but a small one. This I never quite understood, for usually, when a wolf rises to the position and power that he had, he attracts a numerous following. It may be that he had as many as he desired, or perhaps his ferocious temper prevented the increase of his pack. Certain is it that Lobo had only five followers during the latter part of his reign. Each of these, however, was a wolf of renown, most of them were above the ordinary size, one in particular, the second in command, was a veritable giant, but even he was far below the leader in size and prowess. Several of the band, besides the two leaders, were especially noted. One of those was a beautiful white wolf, that the Mexicans called Blanca; this was supposed to be a female, possibly Lobo's mate. Another was a yellow wolf of remarkable swiftness, which, according to current stories had, on several occasions, captured an antelope for the pack.<br>&nbsp;<br>It will be seen, then, that these wolves were thoroughly well-known to the cowboys and shepherds. They were frequently seen and oftener heard, and their lives were intimately associated with those of the cattlemen, who would so gladly have destroyed them. There was not a stockman on the Currumpaw who would not readily have given the value of many steers for the scalp of any one of Lobo's band, but they seemed to possess charmed lives, and defied all manner of devices to kill them. They scorned all hunters, derided all poisons, and continued, for at least five years, to exact their tribute from the Currumpaw ranchers to the extent, many said, of a cow each day. According to this estimate, therefore, the band had killed more than two thousand of the finest stock, for, as was only too well-known, they selected the best in every instance.<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>The old idea that a wolf was constantly in a starving state, and therefore ready to eat anything, was as far as possible from the truth in this case, for these freebooters were always sleek and well-conditioned, and were in fact most fastidious about what they ate. Any animal that had died from natural causes, or that was diseased or tainted, they would not touch, and they even rejected anything that had been killed by the stockmen. Their choice and daily food was the tenderer part of a freshly killed yearling heifer. An old bull or cow they disdained, and though they occasionally took a young calf or colt, it was quite clear that veal or horseflesh was not their favorite diet. It was also known that they were not fond of mutton, although they often amused themselves by killing sheep. One night in November, 1893, Blanca and the yellow wolf killed two hundred and fifty sheep, apparently for the fun of it, and did not eat an ounce of their flesh.<br>&nbsp;<br>These are examples of many stories which I might repeat, to show the ravages of this destructive band. Many new devices for their extinction were tried each year, but still they lived and throve in spite of all the efforts of their foes. A great price was set on Lobo's head, and in consequence poison in a score of subtle forms was put out for him, but he never failed to detect and avoid it. One thing only he feared &#x2013; that was firearms, and knowing full well that all men in this region carried them, he never was known to attack or face a human being. Indeed, the set policy of his band was to take refuge in flight whenever, in the daytime, a man was descried, no matter at what distance. Lobo's habit of permitting the pack to eat only that which they themselves had killed, was in numerous cases their salvation, and the keenness of his scent to detect the taint of human hands or the poison itself, completed their immunity.<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>On one occasion, one of the cowboys heard the too familiar rallying-cry of Old Lobo, and stealthily approaching, he found the Currumpaw pack in a hollow, where they had 'rounded up' a small herd of cattle. Lobo sat apart on a knoll, while Blanca with the rest was endeavoring to 'cut out' a young cow, which they had selected; but the cattle were standing in a compact mass with their heads outward, and presented to the foe a line of horns, unbroken save when some cow, frightened by a fresh onset of the wolves, tried to retreat into the middle of the herd. It was only by taking advantage of these breaks that the wolves had succeeded at all in wounding the selected cow, but she was far from being disabled, and it seemed that Lobo at length lost patience with his followers, for he left his position on the hill and, uttering a deep roar, dashed toward the herd. The terrified rank broke at his charge, and he sprang in among them. Then the cattle scattered like the pieces of a bursting bomb. Away went the chosen victim, but ere she had gone twenty-five yards Lobo was upon her. Seizing her by the neck he suddenly held back with all his force and so threw her heavily to the ground. The shock must have been tremendous, for the heifer was thrown heels over head. Lobo also turned somersault, but immediately recovered himself, and his followers falling on the poor cow, killed her in a few seconds. Lobo took no part in the killing &#x2013; after having thrown the victim, he seemed to say, "Now, why could not some of you have done that at once without wasting so much time?"<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>The man now rode up shouting, the wolves as usual retired, and he, having a bottle of strychnine, quickly poisoned the carcass in three places, then went away, knowing they would return to feed, as they had killed the animal themselves. But next morning, on going to look for his expected victims, he found that, although the wolves had eaten the heifer, they had carefully cut out and thrown aside all those parts that had been poisoned.<br>&nbsp;<br>The dread of this great wolf spread yearly among the ranchmen, and each year a larger price was set on his head, until at last it reached $1,000, an unparalleled wolf-bounty, surely; many a good man has been hunted down for less. Tempted by the promised reward, a Texan ranger named Tannerey came one day galloping up the ca�on of the old Currumpaw. He had a superb outfit for wolf-hunting &#x2013; the best of guns and horses, and a pack of enormous wolf-hounds. Far out on the plains of the Pan-handle, he and his dogs had killed many a wolf, and now he never doubted that, within a few days, old Lobo's scalp would dangle at his saddle-bow.<br>&nbsp;<br>Away they went bravely on their hunt in the gray dawn of a summer morning, and soon the great dogs gave joyous tongue to say that they were already on the track of their quarry. Within two miles, the grizzly band of Currumpaw leaped into view, and the chase grew fast and furious. The part of the wolf-hounds was merely to hold the wolves at bay till the hunter could ride up and shoot them, and this usually was easy on the open plains of Texas; but here a new feature of the country came into play, and showed how well Lobo had chosen his range; for the rocky ca�ons of the Currumpaw and its tributaries intersect the prairies in every direction. The old wolf at once made for the nearest of these and by crossing it got rid of the horsemen. His band then scattered and thereby scattered the dogs, and when they reunited at a distant point of course all of the dogs did not turn up, and the wolves no longer outnumbered, turned on their pursuers and killed or desperately wounded them all. That night when Tannerey mustered his dogs, only six of them returned, and of these, two were terribly lacerated. This hunter made two other attempts to capture the royal scalp, but neither of them was more successful than the first, and on the last occasion his best horse met its death by a fall; so he gave up the chase in disgust and went back to Texas, leaving Lobo more than ever the despot of the region.<br>&nbsp;<br>Next year, two other hunters appeared, determined to win the promised bounty. Each believed he could destroy this noted wolf, the first by means of a newly devised poison, which was to be laid out in an entirely new manner; the other a French Canadian, by poison assisted with certain spells and charms, for he firmly believed that Lobo was a veritable 'loupgarou,' and could not be killed by ordinary means. But cunningly compounded poisons, charms, and incantations were all of no avail against this grizzly devastator. He made his weekly rounds and daily banquets as aforetime, and before many weeks had passed, Calone and Laloche gave up in despair and went elsewhere to hunt.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the spring of 1893, after his unsuccessful attempt to capture Lobo, Joe Calone had a humiliating experience, which seems to show that the big wolf simply scorned his enemies, and had absolute confidence in himself. Calone's farm was on a small tributary of the Currumpaw, in a picturesque ca�on, and among the rocks of this very ca�on, within a thousand yards of the house, old Lobo and his mate selected their den and raised their family that season. There they lived all summer, and killed Joe's cattle, sheep, and dogs, but laughed at all his poisons and traps, and rested securely among the recesses of the cavernous cliffs, while Joe vainly racked his brain for some method of smoking them out, or of reaching them with dynamite. But they escaped entirely unscathed, and continued their ravages as before. "There's where he lived all last summer," said Joe, pointing to the face of the cliff, "and I couldn't do a thing with him. I was like a fool to him."<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>II<br>&nbsp;<br>This history, gathered so far from the cowboys, I found hard to believe until in the fall of 1893, I made the acquaintance of the wily marauder, and at length came to know him more thoroughly than anyone else. Some years before, in the Bingo days, I had been a wolf-hunter, but my occupations since then had been of another sort, chaining me to stool and desk. I was much in need of a change, and when a friend, who was also a ranch-owner on the Currumpaw, asked me to come to New Mexico and try if I could do anything with this predatory pack, I accepted the invitation and, eager to make the acquaintance of its king, was as soon as possible among the mesas of that region. I spent some time riding about to learn the country, and at intervals, my guide would point to the skeleton of a cow to which the hide still adhered, and remark, "That's some of his work."<br>&nbsp;<br>It became quite clear to me that, in this rough country, it was useless to think of pursuing Lobo with hounds and horses, so that poisons or traps were the only available expedients. At present we had no traps large enough, so I set to work with poison.<br>&nbsp;<br>I need not enter into the details of a hundred devices that I employed to circumvent this 'loup-garou'; there was no combination of strychnine, arsenic, cyanide, or prussic acid, that I did not essay; there was no manner of flesh that I did not try as bait; but morning after morning, as I rode forth to learn the result, I found that all my efforts had been useless. The old king was too cunning for me. A single instance will show his wonderful sagacity. Acting on the hint of an old trapper, I melted some cheese together with the kidney fat of a freshly killed heifer, stewing it in a china dish, and cutting it with a bone knife to avoid the taint of metal. When the mixture was cool, I cut it into lumps, and making a hole in one side of each lump, I inserted a large dose of strychnine and cyanide, contained in a capsule that was impermeable by any odor; finally I sealed the holes up with pieces of the cheese itself. During the whole process, I wore a pair of gloves steeped in the hot blood of the heifer, and even avoided breathing on the baits. When all was ready, I put them in a raw-hide bag rubbed all over with blood, and rode forth dragging the liver and kidneys of the beef at the end of a rope. With this I made a ten-mile circuit, dropping a bait at each quarter of a mile, and taking the utmost care, always, not to touch any with my hands.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lobo, generally, came into this part of the range in the early part of each week, and passed the latter part, it was supposed, around the base of Sierra Grande. This was Monday, and that same evening, as we were about to retire, I heard the deep bass howl of his majesty. On hearing it one of the boys briefly remarked, "There he is, we'll see."<br>&nbsp;<br>The next morning I went forth, eager to know the result. I soon came on the fresh trail of the robbers, with Lobo in the lead &#x2013; his track was always easily distinguished. An ordinary wolf 's forefoot is 4� inches long, that of a large wolf 4� inches, but Lobo's, as measured a number of times, was 5� inches from claw to heel; I afterward found that his other proportions were commensurate, for he stood three feet high at the shoulder, and weighed 150 pounds. His trail, therefore, though obscured by those of his followers, was never difficult to trace. The pack had soon found the track of my drag, and as usual followed it. I could see that Lobo had come to the first bait, sniffed about it, and finally had picked it up.<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>Then I could not conceal my delight. "I've got him at last," I exclaimed; "I shall find him stark within a mile," and I galloped on with eager eyes fixed on the great broad track in the dust. It led me to the second bait and that also was gone. How I exulted &#x2013; I surely have him now and perhaps several of his band. But there was the broad paw-mark still on the drag; and though I stood in the stirrup and scanned the plain I saw nothing that looked like a dead wolf. Again I followed &#x2013; to find now that the third bait was gone &#x2013; and the king-wolf 's track led to the fourth, there to learn that he had not really taken a bait at all, but had merely carried them in his mouth. Then having piled the three on the fourth, he scattered filth over them to express his utter contempt for my devices. After this he left my drag and went about his business with the pack he guarded so effectively.<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>This is only one of many similar experiences which convinced me that poison would never avail to destroy this robber, and though I contin...</p><h2>Keeping the Republic: Power and Citizenship in American Politics - Brief Edition</h2><p><p><strong>Keeping the Republic </strong>gives students the <strong>power</strong> to</p> <ul> <li><strong>examine</strong> the narrative of what&#x2032;s going on in American politics,&nbsp; </li> <li><strong>distinguish</strong> fact from fiction and balance from bias, and&nbsp; </li> <li><strong>influence</strong> the message through informed citizenship.&nbsp; </li> </ul> <p><strong>Keeping the Republic</strong> draws students into the study of American politics, showing them how to think critically about "who gets what, and how" while exploring the twin themes of power and citizenship.

G. Wodehouse are legion. He represents an antic high point in the world of farce and social satire. Best known for the creation of two fictional worlds based on Blandings Castle and the Wooster-Jeeves gentleman-valet duo, Wodehouse is appreciated the world over for his exceedingly clever and comically savvy send-ups of the idle rich in Edwardian England.The series begins with two Wooster-Jeeves novels and one Blandings Castle novel. In The Code of the Woosters, it takes all the ingenuity of Jeeves, the gentleman&#39;s gentleman extraordinaire, to rescue his hapless and hopelessly obtuse young employer, Bertie Wooster, from the pickle of a plot to steal a silver jug from the home of an irascible magistrate. In Right Ho, Jeeves Bertie&#39;s old friend Gussie Fink-Nottle has fallen in love and, as usual, makes a hash of the affair until Jeeves comes to his rescue. Pigs Have Wings takes us to Blandings Castle, where a romantic comedy unfolds alongside the intrigue of the Fat Pig competition in Shropshire.With each volume edited and reset and printed on Scottish cream-wove, acid-free paper, sewn and bound in cloth, these novels are elegant additions to any Wodehouse fan&#39;s library.</p><p>A Jeeves and Wooster novel <p>[insert P.G.

And his chum Tuppy Glossop isn&#x2019;t getting on much better with Madeline&#x2019;s delectable friend Angela. </p><p>With so many broken hearts lying about him, Bertie Wooster can&#x2019;t sit idly by. The happiness of a pal &#x2013; two pals, in fact &#x2013; is at stake. But somehow Bertie&#x2019;s best-laid plans land everyone in the soup, and so it&#x2019;s just as well that Jeeves is ever at hand to apply his bulging brains to the problems of young love.</p><b>P.

Most members of Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn were present, the barristers in their robes and their wives in their best costumes. After an hour standing watching, my back was starting to ache, and I envied the few elderly and infirm members who had brought stools.</p><p>The performance of a play at Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn, traditionally held in March, had been cancelled earlier in the month because of heavy snow; late in the month now, it was still unseasonably cold, the breath of actors and audience visible, wafting up like smoke to the high roof-beams. The play that year was a new Interlude, <i>The Trial of Treasure</i>, a heavy-handed moral fable with the gorgeously robed actors portraying the vices and virtues of mankind. As the actor playing Virtue, resplendent in pale robes and a long, white, false beard, lectured Dissimulation on his deceitful ways - appropriately, perhaps, to an audience of lawyers - my attention wandered. I cast my eyes over the shadowed faces of the audience. Treasurer Rowland, a thin-faced, acerbic old man, was eyeing the actors as though wondering whether it might have been better hiring a troupe with less expensive costumes even if this play required no elaborate scenery. Across from me I saw my old enemy Stephen Bealknap, his greedy pale blue eyes studying his fellow lawyers. Those eyes were never still, would never meet yours, and as he saw me looking at him his gaze slid away. He was perhaps the crookedest lawyer I had ever come across; it still smarted that eighteen months before I had been forced to abandon a case against him through the ruthless machinations of his patron, Richard Rich. It struck me that he looked tired, ill.</p><p>Some distance away my friend Roger Elliard, to whose house I was invited to a dinner afterwards, held his wife&#x2019;s hand. A new scene had begun; Lust had made a pact of fellowship with Inclination To Evil. Embracing him, Lust was suddenly seized with pain and crouched on his knees.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p></p><p>Out alas, what sudden passion is this, I am so taken that I cannot stand, the cramp, the cramp has touched me, I shall die without remedy now out of hand.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>The actor, struck down by divine judgement, stretched out a trembling hand to the audience. I saw Bealknap look at him with a sort of puzzled contempt; Roger, though, turned suddenly away. I knew why; I would talk to him later.</p><p>At last the play ended; the players bowed, the audience clapped, and we got our cold limbs into motion and stepped out into Gatehouse Court. The sun was just setting, illuminating the redbrick buildings and the melting snow in the courtyard with an umber light. People walked away to the gate, or if they lived at Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn stepped homewards, wrapping their coats around them. I waited in the doorway for the Elliards, nodding to acquaintances. The audience were the only ones abroad, for it was a Saturday out of law term, Palm Sunday Eve. I looked across to the Elliards&#x2019; lodgings. All the windows were lit and servants could be seen within, bustling with trays. Dorothy&#x2019;s dinners were well known around the Inn, and even at the end of Lent, with red meat forbidden, I knew that she would have large tabling and good belly cheer for the group they had invited.</p><p>Despite the cold I felt relaxed, more peaceful than I had for a long time. In just over a week it would be Easter Sunday, and also the twenty-fifth of March, the official start of the New Year of 1543. Sometimes in recent years I had wondered at this time what grim events the coming year might bring. But I reflected that now I had only good and interesting work, and times with good friends, to look forward to. That morning while dressing I had paused to study my face in the steel mirror in my bedroom; something I seldom did, for the sight of my humped back still distressed me. I saw streaks of grey in my hair, deepening lines on my face. Yet I thought perhaps they gave me something of a distinguished look; and I had passed forty the previous year, I could no longer expect to look young.</p><p>That afternoon, before the performance, I had walked down to the Thames, for I had heard the ice was breaking up at last after the long, bitter winter. I stood at Temple Stairs and looked down at the river. True enough, huge chunks of ice tumbled against each other with great crashes and creaks amid roiling grey waters. I walked back through soft, melting snow, thinking that perhaps spring was coming at last.</p><p>Standing in the doorway of the Hall, I shivered suddenly despite my heavy fur-lined coat, for though the air was definitely warmer today it was still chill and I had never put back the flesh I lost in my bad fever eighteen months before. I jumped slightly as someone clapped me on the shoulder. It was Roger, his slim form swathed in a heavy coat. Beside him his wife Dorothy, her plump cheeks red with cold, smiled at me. Her brown hair was gathered under a round French hood set with pearls.</p><p>&#x2018;You were in a brown study, Matthew,&#x2019; Roger said. &#x2018;Reflecting on the high moral sentiments of the play?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;High as a house but heavy as a horse,&#x2019; Dorothy said.</p><p>&#x2018;That they were,&#x2019; I agreed. &#x2018;Who chose it?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;The Treasurer.&#x2019; Roger looked to where Rowland was talking to an ancient judge, nodding his head gravely. Roger lowered his voice. &#x2018;He wanted something that wasn&#x2019;t politically contentious. Wise in these days. But an Italian comedy would have been better.&#x2019;</p><p>We walked across the courtyard together. I noticed the snow on the Gatehouse Court fountain, which had been frozen this last three months, was almost gone, revealing patches of grey ice. Soon perhaps the fountain would be working again, its gentle plashing sounding across the court. A few coins were exposed on the ice; even with the fountain frozen people still threw money in with a prayer for victory in a case or luck in an affair of the heart; for though they might deny it, lawyers were as superstitious as other men.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>Roger&#x2019;s STEWARDS, an old man called Elias who had been with the family for years, greeted us at the door and took me upstairs to wash my hands. Then I went into the parlour, where fat candles cast a warm buttery light on the chairs and cushions. A dozen guests, all barristers and their wives, already sat or lounged, served with wine by Elias and a boy. A roaring fire warmed the room, bringing sweet smells from the scented herbs on the wooden floor, its light glinting on the silverware on the cloth-covered table. The walls were decorated with framed portraits in the new fashion, mostly of biblical characters. Above the large fireplace stood one of the best pieces of furniture in Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn, Roger&#x2019;s pride and joy. It was a large, carved wooden frieze of intricate design, the branches of trees in full leaf interlaced with flowers and fruits, the heads of animals peering through, deer and boar and even a unicorn. Roger stood beside it, talking to Ambrose Loder from my chambers. His slim form was animated, his fine hands waving as he made some point to the plump barrister, who stood immobile, a sceptical look on his red face.</p><p>Dorothy stood beside him, wearing an expression of good-natured amusement, her colourful clothes a contrast to the black robes of the two lawyers. She wore a green damask dress with gold piping down the front, and a high collar open at the throat; it suited her well. Seeing me, she excused herself and came across.</p><p>I had known Dorothy near twenty years. She was the daughter of a serjeant in my first chambers. We had both been in our early twenties then and I had at once been attracted to Dorothy&#x2019;s elegance, wit and kind nature - a rare combination. She seemed to like my company too, never seemed to mind my bent back, and we became good friends. After a while I dared to think of trying to turn friendship into something more. I had given no signs of my real feelings, though, and therefore had only myself to blame when I learned that Roger, my friend and colleague, had already proposed marriage and been accepted. He later said - and I believed him - that he had not realized my feelings for Dorothy. She had guessed, though, and tried to sweeten the pill by saying she had had a difficult choice to make. I had found that hard to believe, for Roger was handsome as well as clever, with a quicksilver, energetic grace to his movements.</p><p>Dorothy was, like me, past forty now; though apart from little wrinkles visible around her eyes she looked a good deal younger. I bent and kissed her on her full cheeks.</p><p>&#x2018;A merry Palm Sunday to you, Dorothy.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;And to you, Matthew.&#x2019; She squeezed my hand. &#x2018;How is your health?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Good these days.&#x2019; My back had often given me trouble, but these last months I had been conscientious in the exercises my physician friend Guy had prescribed, and had felt much better.</p><p>&#x2018;You look well.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;And you look younger each New Year, Dorothy. May this one bring peace and prosperity.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I hope so. Though there has been a strange portent, have you heard? Two huge fish washed up by the Thames. Great grey things half the size of a house. They must have been under the ice.&#x2019; The twinkle in her eyes told me she found the story, like so much in the world, delightfully absurd.</p><p>&#x2018;Were they alive?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No. They lie on the mudbanks over at Greenwich. People have been crossing London Bridge in hundreds to see them. Everyone says that coming the day before Palm Sunday it portends some terrible happening.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;People are always finding portents these days. It is a passion now among the busy Bible-men of London.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;True.&#x2019; She gave me a searching look, perhaps catching a bitter note in my reply. Twenty years ago Dorothy and Roger and I had all been reformers, hoping for a new Christian fellowship in the world. They still did. But though many of their guests had also been reformers in the early days, most had now retreated to a quiet professional life, frightened and disillusioned by the tides of religious conflict and repression that had flowed ever higher in the decade since the King&#x2019;s break with Rome. I wondered if Dorothy guessed that, for me, faith was almost gone.</p><p>She changed the subject. &#x2018;For us at least the news has been good. We had a letter from Samuel today. The roads to Bristol must be open again.&#x2019; She raised her dark eyebrows. &#x2018;And reading between the lines, I think he has a girl.&#x2019;</p><p>Samuel was Roger and Dorothy&#x2019;s only child, the apple of their eye. Some years before, the family had moved to Bristol, Roger&#x2019;s home town, where he had obtained the post of City Recorder. He had returned to practise at Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn a year before, but Samuel, now eighteen and apprenticed to a cloth merchant, had decided to stay behind; to the sorrow of both his parents, I knew.</p><p>I smiled gently. &#x2018;Are you sure you are not reading your wishes into his letter?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No, he mentions a name. Elizabeth. A merchant&#x2019;s daughter.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;He will not be able to marry till after his apprenticeship.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Good. That will allow time to see if they are suited.&#x2019; She smiled roguishly. &#x2018;And perhaps for me to send some spy to Bristol. Your assistant Barak, perhaps. I hear he is good at such jobs.&#x2019;</p><p>I...</p></p><h2>The Just City (Thessaly, 1)</h2><p><p><i>"Here in the Just City you will become your best selves. You will learn and grow and strive to be excellent." </i><br><i></i><br>Created as an experiment by the time-traveling goddess Pallas Athene, the Just City is a planned community, populated by over ten thousand children and a few hundred adult teachers from all eras of history, along with some handy robots from the far human future&#x2015;all set down together on a Mediterranean island in the distant past.</p><p>The student Simmea, born an Egyptian farmer's daughter sometime between 500 and 1000 A.D, is a brilliant child, eager for knowledge, ready to strive to be her best self. The teacher Maia was once Ethel, a young Victorian lady of much learning and few prospects, who prayed to Pallas Athene in an unguarded moment during a trip to Rome&#x2015;and, in an instant, found herself in the Just City with grey-eyed Athene standing unmistakably before her.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apollo&#x2015;stunned by the realization that there are things mortals understand better than he does&#x2015;has arranged to live a human life, and has come to the City as one of the children. He knows his true identity, and conceals it from his peers. For this lifetime, he is prone to all the troubles of being human.</p><p>Then, a few years in, Sokrates arrives&#x2015;the same Sokrates recorded by Plato himself&#x2015;to ask all the troublesome questions you would expect.

Through these years their home was almost a nature-conservation shrine to thousands of Americans interested in the out-of-doors, in animals, in nature in general. <i>Wapiti Wilderness</i>, begun by Mrs. Murie as a sequel to her <i>Two in the Far North</i>, which told of the Muries' life and expeditions in Alaska, became a book written by both the Muries.<p>In alternate chapters, Olaus tells of his work as a field biologist for the old U.S. Bureau of Biological Survey and recounts stories of his studies of the elk and the other great animals of the West. And Mrs. Murie, from her side, describes their life together, on the trail, in the various camps, and nature adventures in that wilderness in all seasons. The book is replete with stories of Jackson Hole people, "pioneer poets," and the wild creatures that made their way into the Murie household. Olaus Murie's evocative pen-and-ink drawings illuminate each chapter, and four pages of photographs help complete the picture of what life was like in the wapiti wilderness.</p></p><p></p><h2>On Solid Ground : Strategies for Teaching Reading K-3</h2><p>Enter Sharon Taberski's classroom and enter a world where children take pride, take risks, and most of all, take reading seriously. It's not utopia by any means; Sharon deals with the same issues other teachers face: limited resources, tremendous diversity, and the constant threat of overcrowding. What makes her exceptional is her clear vision. She is systematic in her thinking, wise in her decision making. Most of all, she understands her role as a teacher and goals for each student. This is why Sharon is on solid ground. <p> In her book, Sharon shares what she's gained in her twenty years of working with children and teachers. It's organized not around a set of prescribed skills, but around a series of interconnected interactions with the learner: </p><ul> <li><b>Assessment:</b> Sharon begins by describing her procedures for assessing children's reading and then using what she finds to inform her work. She covers scheduling and managing reading conferences, taking oral-reading records, and using retellings and discussions as tools. </li><li><b>Demonstration:</b> Once she has identified strengths and needs, Sharon demonstrates strategies to help her students become better readers. In this section, she explains how she uses shared reading and read aloud as platforms for figuring out words and comprehending texts, and explores small-group work - guided reading and word-study groups - and teaching children one on one. </li><li><b>Practice:</b> Here, Sharon describes how she uses independent reading as a time for practice, spelling out the very active roles she and her students play. She also devotes a complete chapter to matching children with books for independent reading. </li><li><b>Response:</b> It's important for students to know they're doing well and where they must concentrate their efforts. Sharon explains how her students use writing and dialogue as tools to better understanding themselves as readers. </li></ul> <i>On Solid Ground</i> is informed by current thinking, yet loaded with advice, booklists, ready-to-use reproducibles, and - of course - the words and work of real children. Sharon's approach is clear, sensible, timeless. You'll turn to her book throughout your career.</p><p><p>Sharon Taberski is a nationally recognized educator, author, and presenter. A teacher for 28 years, Sharon currently works in school districts throughout the country helping teachers set up reading and writing workshops, and think systematically about how to best accomplish their goals. She also presents keynotes and seminars throughout the US and Canada. Sharon has been a member of NCTE's editorial board, and has served on the development committee for the Primary Literacy Standards (more commonly known as New Standards) by the National Center on Education and the Economy. In her latest work, Comprehension from the Ground Up, Sharon cuts through the pressurized, strategy-overloaded, fluency-crazed atmosphere surrounding reading instruction to lay out reading and workshop practices that are most effective in the primary grades. The companion DVD, Lessons from the Ground Up, shows Sharon in the classroom, modeling effective ways to develop comprehension in real-life classroom settings through exemplary teaching techniques and is perfect for your workshop or PLC. Sharon is also the author of It's ALL About Comprehension, Teaching K-3 Readers from the Ground Up, a DVD set for long-term staff development that shows how to teach children through rich, varied, comprehension-building experiences through the literacy block. Sharon is also the author of On Solid Ground: Strategies for Teaching Reading K-3, and the video series A Close-Up Look at Teaching Reading: Focusing on Children and Our Goals.</p>&#x201c;Sharon is the consummate teacher across the hall, willing to share her best practice, her materials, her management, and most of all, the wisdom she has acquired from years of devotion and study.&#x201d;&#x2013;Shelley Harwayne</p><h2>The Women</h2><p><p>A <i>New York Times </i>Notable Book</p><p>Daring and fiercely original, <i>The Women</i> is at once a memoir, a psychological study, a sociopolitical manifesto, and an incisive adventure in literary criticism. It is conceived as a series of portraits analyzing the role that sexual and racial identity played in the lives and work of the writer's subjects: his mother, a self-described "Negress," who would not be defined by the limitations of race and gender; the mother of Malcolm X, whose mixed-race background and eventual descent into madness contributed to her son's misogyny and racism; brilliant, Harvard-educated Dorothy Dean, who rarely identified with other blacks or women, but deeply empathized with white gay men; and the late Owen Dodson, a poet and dramatist who was female-identified and who played an important role in the author's own social and intellectual formation.</p><p>Hilton Als submits both racial and sexual stereotypes to his inimitable scrutiny with relentless humor and sympathy. The results are exhilarating. <i>The Women</i> is that rarest of books: a memorable work of self-investigation that creates a form of all its own.</p></p><p>This memoir is a meditation on what it means to be black, gay, and female in U.S. culture. Als, a gay man, writes about his mother; his sisters; Malcolm X's mother; and Dorothy Dean, an African-American woman who was at the center of New York's gay male circles. But his real subject is--as he puts it--what it means to be a "Negress" in white culture. Examining how race and gender shape all of our attitudes toward what it means to be a "woman," "man" or "homosexual," Als gets at the root of self-definition in a world that constructs very limited options. <i>The Women</i> is elegantly written and moves us through a variety of ideas and emotions with a fluidity that is both graceful and startling; it is unique in contemporary writings about race, sexuality, and gender.Daring, fiercely original, and brilliant, The Women is at once a memoir, a psychological study, a sociopolitical manifesto, and an incisive adventure in literary criticism. It is conceived as a series of portraits analyzing the role that sexual and racial identity played in the lives and work of the writer&#39;s subjects. Als begins with his mother, a self-described &#34;Negress&#34;, who would not be defined by the limitations of race and gender. He goes on to ask who the mother of Malcolm X was, and shows how her mixed-race background and eventual descent into madness contributed to her son&#39;s misogyny and racism. He describes how the brilliant, Harvard-educated Dorothy Dean rarely identified with other blacks or women, but deeply empathized with white gay men. Finally, he portrays the late Owen Dodson, a poet and dramatist who was female-identified and who played an important role in the author&#39;s own social and intellectual formation.

Hallie&#39;s father, considering this a dangerous place for a young woman of nineteen to live alone, told her he thought she was going on a wild goose chase. &#34;Then I&#39;ll gather my geese,&#34; she told him, with determination and independence. These traits stayed with Hallie all her life, and were indispensable in her role as a ranch wife. Raised as a &#34;proper&#34; Southern woman, Hallie was not prepared for the difficulties she faced when she moved to her new home, the Stillwell Ranch, in 1918. But she quickly became an invaluable part of the workings on the ranch. She watched and learned from her husband, Roy Stillwell, and she adjusted to the new life-style that she grew to love. The ranch hands, who thought she would only last six months, came to respect her and her abilities to do as much work as any man on the ranch. They became a family. Then Roy and Hallie started a family of their own. Three children were a handful, and the Stillwell family split its time between the ranch and a home in town. On the ranch outside Marathon, near the Mexican border, work was hard and joy came in the simple things. After working cattle all day, relaxing under the arbor in front of the house was a pleasure. Hallie had a favorite rock out behind the house, and she often sat on it to watch the sun set, take a break from her energetic youngsters, or otherwise gain some tranquility and perspective.The ranch and its inhabitants survived two world wars, the depression, droughts, an influenza epidemic, as well as the everyday troubles of ranching in the Big Bend country. Hallie&#39;s story, told in a personal and engaging way, is fascinating reading for anyone interested in the history of pioneering ranching in Texas.</p><p>Hallie Stillwell was born in Waco and lived in Alpine until her death in 1997. She has taught school, managed a restaurant, raised children, and been a justice of the peace. She was a rancher since 1918 and a news reporter since 1930.<p>YA-- Born in 1879, Stillwell was destined to help tame the last frontier of Texas known as the Big Bend Country. She records this story in some 20 vignettes, beginning with her marriage in 1918. She recounts how she learns to cope with a strong, respectful but often silent husband, the physical demands of a developing ranch, and the strong love that grew to encompass the ranch family. In a simple manner she paints her word pictures, illustrating the indispensable roles of the frontier woman as bride, companion, helpmate, and mother. The photographs of the family interspersed throughout provide a visual picture. This is a readable book that will help YAs develop an appreciation for the demands of such a lifestyle. Here also is a woman worthy of admiration for her determination, sacrifices, and contributions. A wonderful book for American history classes, women's studies, and family history seminars. --Dolores M.

T. H. White, the author of <i>The Once and Future King</i> and <i>Mistress Masham&#x2019;s Repose</i>, was a young writer who found himself rifling through old handbooks of falconry. A particular sentence&#x2014;&#x201c;the bird reverted to a feral state&#x201d;&#x2014;seized his imagination, and, White later wrote, &#x201c;A longing came to my mind that I should be able to do this myself. The word &#x2018;feral&#x2019; has a kind of magical potency which allied itself to two other words, &#x2018;ferocious&#x2019; and &#x2018;free.&#x2019;&#x201d; Immediately, White wrote to Germany to acquire a young goshawk. Gos, as White named the bird, was ferocious and Gos was free, and White had no idea how to break him in beyond the ancient (and, though he did not know it, long superseded) practice of depriving him of sleep, which meant that he, White, also went without rest. Slowly man and bird entered a state of delirium and intoxication, of attraction and repulsion that looks very much like love.<br><br>White kept a daybook describing his volatile relationship with Gos&#x2014;at once a tale of obsession, a comedy of errors, and a hymn to the hawk. It was this that became <i>The Goshawk</i>, one of modern literature&#x2019;s most memorable and surprising encounters with the wilderness&#x2014;as it exists both within us and without.</p><p>The Goshawk chronicles a concentrated duel between the author and a great hawk. It is the journal of an intense clash of wills - during the bird's training - in which the pride and endurance of the wild raptor are worn down by the insistent willpower of the falconer. The story is by turns comic and tragic - and it is all-absorbing. (5 1/2 X 8 1/4, 222 pages, diagrams)<br><b>T. H. White</b> (1906&#x2014;1964) was born in Bombay, India, and educated at Queen&#x2019;s College, Cambridge. His childhood was unhappy&#x2014;&#x201c;my parents loathed each other,&#x201d; he later wrote&#x2014;and he grew up to become a solitary person with a deep fund of strange lore and a tremendous enthusiasm for fishing, hunting, and flying (which he took up to overcome his fear of heights). White taught for some years at the Stowe School until the success in 1936 of <i>England Have My Bones</i>, a book about outdoor adventure, allowed him to quit teaching and become a full-time writer. Along with <i>The Goshawk</i>, White was the author of twenty-six published works, including his famed sequence of Arthurian novels, <i>The Once and Future King</i>; the fantasy <i>Mistress Masham&#x2019;s Repose</i> (published in The New York Review of Books Children&#x2019;s Collection); a collection of essays on the eighteenth century, <i>The Age of Scandal</i>; and a translation of a medieval Latin bestiary, <i>A Book of Beasts.</i> He died at sea on his way home from an American lecture tour and is buried in Piraeus, Greece.<br><br><b>Marie Winn</b>&#x2019;s recent book, <i>Red-Tails in Love: Pale Male&#x2019;s Story</i>, featured a now-famous red-tailed hawk. Her column on nature and bird-watching appeared for twelve years in <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, and she has written on diverse subjects for <i>The New York Times Magazine</i> and <i>Smithsonian</i>. Her forthcoming book, <i>Central Park in the Dark</i>, will be published in the spring of 2008.</p><h2>Edible Forest Gardens, Vol. 1: Ecological Vision and Theory for Temperate Climate Permaculture</h2><p><p><em>Edible Forest Gardens</em> is a groundbreaking two-volume work that spells out and explores the key concepts of forest ecology and applies them to the needs of natural gardeners in temperate climates. Volume I lays out the vision of the forest garden and explains the basic ecological principles that make it work. In Volume II, Dave Jacke and Eric Toensmeier move on to practical considerations: concrete ways to design, establish, and maintain your own forest garden. Along the way they present case studies and examples, as well as tables, illustrations, and a uniquely valuable "plant matrix" that lists hundreds of the best edible and useful species.</p> <p>Taken together, the two volumes of <em>Edible Forest Gardens</em> offer an advanced course in ecological gardening--one that will forever change the way you look at plants and your environment.</p></p><p>"...But the book I will be keeping by me for the seasons ahead... is Edible Forest Gardens by Dave Jacke with Eric Toensmeier. In its way this book--the first of two volumes--is a sequel to the wonderful Tree Crops: A Permanent Agriculture (1929) by J. Russell Smith.... Edible Forest Gardens offers a vision of the garden that reaches well beneath its aesthetic surface and into its ecological depths. It reminds us that whatever gardens are an oasis from, they can never be an oasis from the natural world or our own underlying economic needs." --Verlyn Klinkenborg The New York Times Book Review June 5, 2005 <p>"This is certainly the most thorough and realistic assessment of the potential for temperate perennial-based gardening that I have seen -- and I've read everything I've been able to find on temperate perennial crops, going back to J. Russell Smith and John Hershey... </p><p>The first volume of Edible Forest Gardens is a superb primer on ecology as it relates to horticulture in general, and I highly recommend it even for gardeners who aren't primarily interested in useful perennials..." --Greg Williams Publisher, Hort Ideas</p>From the Introduction: An Invitation to Adventure <p>Picture yourself in a forest where almost everything around you is food. Mature and maturing fruit and nut trees form an open canopy. If you look carefully, you can see fruits swelling on many branches&#x2014;pears, apples, persimmons, pecans, and chestnuts. Shrubs fill the gaps in the canopy. They bear raspberries, blueberries, currants, hazelnuts, and other lesser-known fruits, flowers, and nuts at different times of the year. Assorted native wildflowers, wild edibles, herbs, and perennial vegetables thickly cover the ground. You use many of these plants for food or medicine. Some attract beneficial insects, birds, and butterflies. Others act as soil builders, or simply help keep out weeds. Here and there vines climb on trees, shrubs, or arbors with fruit hanging through the foliage&#x2014;hardy kiwis, grapes, and passionflower fruits. In sunnier glades large stands of Jerusalem artichokes grow together with groundnut vines. These plants support one another as they store energy in their! roots for later harvest and winter storage. Their bright yellow and deep violet flowers enjoy the radiant warmth from the sky. </p><p>What Is an Edible Forest Garden? </p><p>An edible forest garden is a perennial polyculture of multipurpose plants. Most plants regrow every year without replanting: perennials. Many species grow together: a polyculture. Each plant contributes to the success of the whole by fulfilling many functions: multipurpose. In other words, a forest garden is an edible ecosystem, a consciously designed community of mutually beneficial plants and animals intended for human food production. Edible forest gardens provide more than just a variety of foods. The seven F&#x2019;s apply here: food, fuel, fiber, fodder, fertilizer, and "farmaceuticals," as well as fun. A beautiful, lush environment can be a conscious focus of your garden design, or a side benefit you enjoy (see Figure 0.1). </p><p>Forest gardens mimic forest ecosystems, those natural perennial polycultures once found throughout the world&#x2019;s humid climates. In much of North America, your garden would soon start reverting to forest if you were to stop tilling and weeding it. Annual and perennial weeds would first colonize the bare soil. Shrubs would soon shade out the weeds. Then, sun-loving pioneer trees would move in and a forest would be born. Eventually, even these pioneers would succumb to longer-lived, more shade-tolerant species. It can take many decades for this process, called succession, to result in a mature forest. </p><p>We humans work hard to hold back succession&#x2014;mowing, weeding, plowing, and spraying. If the successional process were the wind, we would be constantly motoring against it. Why not put up a sail and glide along with the land&#x2019;s natural tendency to become forest? Edible forest gardening is about expanding the horizons of our food gardening across the full range of the successional sequence, from field to forest, and everything in between. </p><p>Besides the food and other products, you should design your forest garden for self-renewing, self-fertilizing self-maintenance. For a self-renewing garden, plant mainly perennials or self-sowing annuals. Allow a healthy soil community to develop by mulching and leaving the soil undisturbed. Build soil fertility with plants that fix nitrogen, amass soil minerals, act as mulch sources, or a blend of these. Reduce or eliminate your pest control work by providing food and shelter for insectivorous birds, and predatory and parasitic insects. Fragrant plants, such as onions, may confuse insect pests and slow their march toward your crops. In fact, you can reduce pest and disease problems simply by mixing things up, rather than planting in blocks of the same species! All these things, and more, reduce the amount of maintenance your garden needs and increase its yields. When we mimic how nature works and design well, we can reduce the work of sustaining ourselves to mulching, some pruning, occasional weeding, and minimal pest and disease management (depending on the crops you grow). Oh, and then there&#x2019;s the harvesting! </p><p>Essentially, edible forest gardening is the art and science of putting plants together in woodland-like patterns that forge mutually beneficial relationships, creating a garden ecosystem that is more than the sum of its parts. You can grow fruits, nuts, vegetables, herbs, mushrooms, other useful plants, and animals in a way that mimics natural ecosystems. You can create a beautiful, diverse, high-yield garden that is largely self-maintained. </p><p>Gardening LIKE the Forest vs. Gardening IN the Forest </p><p>Edible forest gardening is not necessarily gardening in the forest. It is gardening like the forest. You don&#x2019;t need to have an existing woodland if you want to forest garden, though you can certainly work with one. Forest gardeners use the forest as a design metaphor, a model of structure and function, while adapting the design to focus on meeting human needs in a small space. We learn how forests work and then participate in the creation of an ecosystem in our backyards that can teach us things about ecology and ourselves while we eat our way through it. Gardening like a forest is what this book is all about. </p><p>Gardening in the forest is different. We can transform an existing piece of woodland into an edible forest garden, and this book will explain how, but there are many other ways to garden in the forest. These include the restoration of natural woodlands, ecological forestry, and the creation of primarily aesthetic woodland gardens. The latter forms of gardening in the forest are not what this book is about. If you want to garden in the forest in any of those ways, see the resources listed in the appendix. If you want to grow food in a garden like a forest, read on.</p></p><h2>Chasing Space Young Readers&#39; Edition</h2><p><p><strong>"In <em>Chasing Space</em>, Leland Melvin tackles stupendous obstacles with dogged determination, showing you what is indeed possible in life&#x2014;if you belive." &#x2014;Neil deGrasse Tyson, author of <em>Astrophysics for People in a Hurry </em>and <em>Welcome to the Universe</em></strong></p><p><strong>Winner of the 2019 Grand Canyon Reader Award for Tween Non-Fiction</strong></p><p><strong>Meet Leland Melvin&#x2014;football star, NASA astronaut, and professional dream chaser. </strong></p><p>In this inspiring memoir, adapted from the simultaneous version for adults, young readers will get to learn about Leland Melvin&#x2019;s remarkable life story, from being drafted by the Detroit Lions to bravely orbiting our planet in the International Space Station to writing songs with will.i.am, working with Serena Williams, and starring in top-rated television shows like <em>The Dog Whisperer</em>, <em>Top Chef</em>, and <em>Child Genius</em>.</p><p>With do-it-yourself experiments in the back of the book and sixteen pages of striking full-color photographs, this is the perfect book to inspire young readers.</p><p>When the former Detroit Lion&#x2019;s football career was cut short by an injury, Leland didn&#x2019;t waste time mourning his broken dream.

She studied at the Sorbonne and The School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences (L'�cole des Hautes �tudes en Sciences Sociales), and later taught at such institutions as Vassar College and University of California&#x2014;Berkeley.<b>The Straight Mind</b> is French literary theorist Monique Wittig's first collection of essays centering on women's struggle for liberation from sexism and classism. These nine essays comprise a thoughtful and unique approach to the study of historical materialism and dialectics, and transverse philosophical, political, and literary theory. Monique Wittig describes this collection as a focus on "lesbian materialism," in which she examines men and women as distinct classes rather than as "essentialist" categories. "Lesbians are not women," writes Monique Wittig, and she presents powerful ideas about how the idea of "woman" is socially constructed and used to convey certain images. It is not enough, she argues, to transform economic oppression because not all oppression is, at the source, economic. Sexism will continue to exist even in a society where all people have equal economic opportunities. Only by transforming our thought processes, and in turn, our language, can we transform our society into one in which there is no longer the dominant and the dominated: "In other words, this means there cannot any longer be women and men, and that as classes and categories of thought or language they have to disappear, politically, economically, ideologically." Controversial and abstract, these are essays that challenge and provoke on both intellectual and emotional levels. <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Heather Downey</i></p><h2>The Secret of Skull Mountain (Hardy Boys, Book 27)</h2><p>There is a crisis in Bayport!

Following in the footsteps of the editor&#39;s first book in the series, Harnessing the Wheelwork of Nature, Dr. Tom Valone&#39;s book chronologically traces the original intention that Nikola Tesla had for his wireless electricity and how he updated and expanded upon it later on, with reprints of his key articles, to the recent genius engineers and physicists who are now finally bringing this last and most elusive, highly advanced Tesla technology into reality. The Corum article (along with the Peterson article) on the Zenneck wave transmission experiments culminates the viewpoints of all of the book&#39;s contributors. Its purposeful placement as the last chapter of the book, is because this exclusive article publication is a major scientific breakthrough, as testified by the book&#39;s endorsement from Brigadier General Michael Miller, and foretells the understandable, visionary road to the corporate formation of wireless power utilities. Furthermore, this is the first and only book in the world which explains how an electromagnetic wave traveling across the electrically conductive surface of the earth, was predicted by Tesla and Zenneck (two pictures in the book show them together on pages 74 and 381) and why it is the essential missing link of any Tesla wireless transmission theory. Many of the contributors also nicely explain the &#34;surface wave phenomenon&#34; as well as &#34;resonant earth-ionosphere&#34; modes of electrical transmission without wires that compliments the surface wave theory and experiment. Nikola Tesla&#39;s Electricity Unplugged therefore is a treasure compared to any other Tesla reference book currently in print, since it is jam-packed with personal stories of Tesla, such as one reprinted from the prestigious Smithsonian magazine, along with great illustrated slideshows adapted for the book format, the &#34;secret&#34; history of Tesla&#39;s wireless, the real Tesla electric car, high Q resonant power transfer examples being used today by Qualcomm, &#34;Tesla unplugged&#34; explained in an easy-to-understand presentation by a Brookhaven National Lab scientist, wireless electricity article based on scalar waves, even including a couple amazing rigorous equation articles with wireless solutions for the tech audience, a unique and evocative Foreword by Nikola Tesla&#39;s last living direct descendant, all presented in a 457-page paperback book, suitable as a college or high school reader, or simply as an eye-opening, optimistic window onto the electrical genius regarded as the &#34;Master of Lightning,&#34; with a priceless collection of nineteen (19) contributors not available anywhere else.</p><p>Nikola Tesla (1856 &#x2015; 1943) was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, physicist, and futurist who is best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.<br><br>David Hatcher Childress, known as the real-life Indiana Jones to the many fans of his books, is a captivating speaker and the author or coauthor of over 25 books.

Unexpectedly, it triggered a chain of events that forever changed Myles' life, culminating in an unjust accusation of treason that brought disgrace to the house of Falworth. The only hope of redeeming the family's reputation and fortunes rested on Myles' training for knighthood, so that he might challenge the king's champion and triumph in an ordeal by battle.<br>Set in 15th-century England, <i>Men of Iron</i> offers the finest historical fiction in the best traditions of the <i>Knights of the Round Table</i> and <i>Ivanhoe</i>. Author Howard Pyle, who wrote and illustrated many other classic Arthurian romances and stories of Robin Hood, blends fascinating period detail about knighthood and chivalry with a stirring coming-of-age tale. First published in 1892, this classic story remains a great favorite with young readers as well as among educators, due to the author's effortless way of teaching virtues such as courage, loyalty, steadfastness, and generosity. An excellent and inspiring choice to read aloud to children as young as nine, it can be read independently by 12- to 16-year-olds.</p><p>The stories and drawings of Howard Pyle (1853-1911) epitomize &#34;the golden age of American illustration.&#34; A priceless contribution to American children&#39;s literature, Pyle&#39;s work set a standard of excellence, with tales and images remarkable for their engaging simplicity and penetrating realism.Men of Iron<br>CHAPTER 1Myles Falworth was but eight years of age at that time, and it was only afterwards, and when he grew old enough to know more of the ins and outs of the matter, that he could remember by bits and pieces the things that afterwards happened; how one evening a knight came clattering into the court-yard upon a horse, red-nostrilled and smeared with the sweat and foam of a desperate ride--Sir John Dale, a dear friend of the blind Lord.Even though so young, Myles knew that something very serious had happened to make Sir John so pale and haggard, and he dimly remembered leaning against the knight's iron-covered knees, looking up into his gloomy face, and asking him if he was sick to look so strange. Thereupon those who had been too troubled before to notice him, bethought themselves of him, and sent him to bed, rebellious at having to go so early.He remembered how the next morning, looking out of a window high up under the eaves, he saw a great troop of horsemen come riding into the court-yard beneath, where a powdering of snow had whitened everything, and of how the leader, a knight clad in black armor, dismounted and enteredthe great hall doorway below, followed by several of the band.He remembered how some of the castle women were standing in a frightened group upon the landing of the stairs, talking together in low voices about a matter he did not understand, excepting that the armed men who had ridden into the courtyard had come for Sir John Dale. None of the women paid any attention to him; so, shunning their notice, he ran off down the winding stairs, expecting every moment to be called back again by some one of them.A crowd of castle people, all very serious and quiet, were gathered in the hall, where a number of strange men-at-arms lounged upon the benches, while two billmen in steel caps and leathern jacks stood guarding the great door, the butts of their weapons resting upon the ground, and the staves crossed, barring the door-way.In the anteroom was the knight in black armor whom Myles had seen from the window. He was sitting at the table, his great helmet lying upon the bench beside him, and a quart beaker of spiced wine at his elbow. A clerk sat at the other end of the same table, with inkhorn in one hand and pen in the other, and a parchment spread in front of him.Master Robert, the castle steward, stood before the knight, who every now and then put to him a question, which the other would answer, and the clerk write the answer down upon the parchment.His father stood with his back to the fireplace, looking down upon the floor with his blind eyes, his brows drawn moodily together, and the scar of the great wound that he had received at the tournament at York--the wound that had made him blind--showing red across his forehead, as it always did when he was angered or troubled.There was something about it all that frightened Myles, who crept to his father's side, and slid his little hand into the palm that hung limp and inert. In answer to the touch, his father grasped the hand tightly, but did not seem otherwise to notice that he was there. Neither did the black knight pay any attention to him, but continued putting his questions to Master Robert.Then, suddenly, there was a commotion in the hall without, loud voices, and a hurrying here and there. The black knight half arose, grasping a heavy iron mace that lay upon the bench beside him, and the next moment Sir John Dale himself, as pale as death, walked into the antechamber. He stopped in the very middle of the room. "I yield me to my Lord's grace and mercy," said he to the black knight, and they were the last words he ever uttered in this world.The black knight shouted out some words of command, and swinging up the iron mace in his hand, strode forward clanking towards Sir John, who raised his arm as though to shield himself from the blow. Two or three of those who stood in the hall without came running into the room with drawn swords and bills, and little Myles, crying out with terror, hid his face in his father's long gown.The next instant came the sound of a heavy blow and of a groan, then another blow and the sound of one falling upon the ground. Then the clashing of steel, and in the midst Lord Falworth crying, in a dreadful voice, "Thou traitor! thou coward! thou murderer!"Master Robert snatched Myles away from his father, and bore him out of the room in spite of his screams and struggles, and he remembered just one instant's sight of Sir John lying still and silent upon his face, and of the black knight standing above him, with the terrible mace in his hand stained a dreadful red.It was the next day that Lord and Lady Falworth and little Myles, together with three of the more faithful of their people, left the castle.His memory of past things held a picture for Myles of old Diccon Bowman standing over him in the silence of midnight with a lighted lamp in his hand, and with it a recollection of being bidden to hush when he would have spoken, and of being dressed by Diccon and one of the women, bewildered with sleep, shuddering and chattering with cold.He remembered being wrapped in the sheepskin that lay at the foot of his bed, and of being carried in Diccon Bowman's arms down the silent darkness of the winding stair-way,with the great black giant shadows swaying and flickering upon the stone wall as the dull flame of the lamp swayed and flickered in the cold breathing of the night air.Below were his father and mother and two or three others. A stranger stood warming his hands at a newly-made fire, and little Myles, as he peeped from out the warm sheepskin, saw that he was in riding-boots and was covered with mud. He did not know till long years afterwards that the stranger was a messenger sent by a friend at the King's court, bidding his father fly for safety.They who stood there by the red blaze of the fire were all very still, talking in whispers and walking on tiptoes, and Myles's mother hugged him in her arms, sheepskin and all, kissing him, with the tears streaming down her cheeks, and whispering to him, as though he could understand their trouble, that they were about to leave their home forever.Then Diccon Bowman carried him out into the strangeness of the winter midnight.Outside, beyond the frozen moat, where the osiers stood stark and stiff in their winter nakedness, was a group of dark figures waiting for them with horses. In the pallid moonlight Myles recognized the well-known face of Father Edward, the Prior of St. Mary's.After that came a long ride through that silent night upon the saddle-bow in front of Diccon Bowman; then a deep, heavy sleep, that fell upon him in spite of the galloping of the horses.When next he woke the sun was shining, and his home and his whole life were changed.All new material copyright � 2006 by Tom Doherty Associates, LLC</p><h2>Baker Creek Vegan Cookbook</h2><p>Tired of genetically modified food, but unsure of what to make and how to cook it?

Seventy-five years after the D-day landings we finally get to see, close-up and in dramatic detail, who was responsible for rescuing, and insisting upon, the great American-led invasion of France in June 1944, and why the invasion was led by Eisenhower. As FDR's D-day triumph turns to personal tragedy, we watch with heartbreaking compassion the course of the disease, and how, in the months left him as US commander in chief, the dying president attempted at Hawaii, Quebec, and Yalta to prepare the United Nations for an American-backed postwar world order.

Not only is quinoa high in protein (more than any other grain) but the protein it supplies is complete protein, which means it includes all the essential amino acids. It's also an excellent source of magnesium, folate, phosphorus, iron and fiber so it's an ideal ingredient for vegans, vegetarians and flexitarians. And because it's also gluten-free, it's a valuable ingredient for anyone affected by gluten intolerance. </p><p> Quinoa naturally has a wonderful texture (reminiscent of couscous) and a delicious nutty flavor, is quick and easy to work with and is now readily and inexpensively available in grocery and health food stores. And because it comes in so many different forms -- like puffed, rolled, as a flour or whole (seeds) -- it lends itself to a myriad of recipe ideas. Camilla, with her degree in food studies, has created mouthwatering quinoa recipes suitable for every meal and occasion -- these excellent recipes are sure to become a mainstay in home kitchens. </p><p> Get your breakfast off to an excellent start with either Quinoa Granola, Chorizo-Quinoa Hash Browns or a Quick Quinoa Breakfast Burrito with enough energy to burn through to the afternoon. Your next get-together can be both delicious and nutritious with Smoky Quinoa-Sausage Sliders, Herbed Cornbread Bites or Quinoa-Olive Tapenade. These recipes take you from breakfast and appetizers to soups, stews, chilis, meatless mains, lean chicken, meat and fish entrees, to breads, muffins, scones, salads and side dishes. Camilla also includes comprehensive and interesting information on the nutritional values and history of quinoa along with handy tips and techniques for preparation. </p></p><p><p> <b>Camilla V.

She has compiled a fairly impressive roster of dishes that could fill in for any course, from breakfast to dessert. But one-ingredient cookbooks, unless wittily and creatively executed, often suffer from &#x201c;muchness.&#x201d; By the time readers reach midpoint, that mainstay ingredient is ready to be shuffled aside. Although lighter versions of familiar proteins are used, the feeling lingers that this is more than a gluten-free, vegan-haven book. Metrics rule&#x2014;directions are couched in grams and milliliters. Finally, some recipes are simply better than others (e.g., apple custard pie, granola), but unless experienced cooks test the dishes, an average kitchen wiz won&#x2019;t know.

Fourth, the trades (<em>Publishers Weekly</em>, <em>Library Journal</em>, etc.) have praised it. Fifth, is enjoying enthusiastic support from early readers.

This groundbreaking research has spurred hundreds of studies and programs, including the White House�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s <i>Bridging the Word Gap</i> campaign and <i>Too Small to Fail</i>, a joint initiative of the Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton foundation.<p> Betty Hart and Todd Risley wanted to know why, despite best efforts in preschool programs to equalize opportunity, children from low-income homes remain well behind their more economically advantaged peers years later in school. Each month, they recorded one full hour of every word spoken at home between parent and child in 42 families, categorized as professional, working class, or welfare families. Two and a half years of coding and analyzing every utterance in 1,318 transcripts followed. By age 3, the recorded spoken vocabularies of the children from the professional families were larger than those of the parents in the welfare families. Between professional and welfare parents, there was a difference of almost 300 words spoken per hour. Extrapolating this verbal interaction to four years, a child in a professional family would accumulate experience with almost 45 million words, while an average child in a welfare family would hear just 13 million&#x2014;coining the phrase <i>the 30 million word gap</i>.</p><p> The implications of this painstaking study are staggering: Hart and Risley's follow-up studies at age 9 show that the large differences in children's language experience were tightly linked to large differences in child outcomes. As the authors note in their preface to the 2002 printing of <i>Meaningful Differences</i>, "the most important aspect to evaluate in child care settings for very young children is the amount of talk actually going on, moment by moment, between children and their caregivers." By giving children positive interactions and experiences with adults who take the time to teach vocabulary, oral language concepts, and emergent literacy concepts, children should have a better chance to succeed at school and in the workplace. </p><p></p><p>Learn more about how parent and children's language interactions affect learning to talk in Hart &amp; Risley's companion book The Social World of Children Learning to Talk.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><p>Meaningful Differences establishes a scientifically substantiated link between children&#39;s early family experience and their later intellectual growth - a link that exists regardless of a child&#39;s race. This compelling story describes the authors&#39; years of research as they search for the roots of intellectual disparity. Hart and Risley examined the daily lives of 1- and 2-year-old children in typical American families. They found staggering contrasts at the extremes of advantage - and within the middle class - in the amount of interaction between parents and children. These differences in the amount of early family experience translate into striking disparities in the children&#39;s later vocabulary growth rate, vocabulary use, and IQ test scores - critical measures of an individual&#39;s ability to succeed at school and in the workplace. Meaningful Differences, the culmination of Hart and Risley&#39;s decades of collaboration, reveals profound effects of environment on development.<br> Betty Hart, Ph.D., began her career in the early 1960s at the Institute for Child Development at the University of Washington, where she participated in the original demonstrations of the power of learning principles in influencing young children.

The author examines the nature and extent of collaboration and resistance, different experiences of Occupation, the persecution of the Jews, intellectual and cultural life under Occupation, and the purge trials that followed. He concludes by tracing the legacy and memory of the Occupation since 1945. Taking in ordinary peoples' experiences, this volume uncovers the conflicting memories of occupation which ensure that even today France continues to debate the legacy of the Vichy years.<br></p><p><br><strong>Julian Jackson</strong> is a Professor of History at the University of Wales, Swansea.<br>eople from other Allied countries joke that, according to the French, every one of them participated in the resistance to German occupation during WWII. Jackson, a professor of history at the University of Wales-Swansea, spares no one in exploring not only the events of wartime France, but also developments in historical perspectives on the collaborationist Vichy regime and the Resistance. Moreover, he looks forward to future revelations. Between these endpoints lies a convoluted landscape bearing little resemblance to the usual simplistic pictures. Jackson's excellent study is timely those who remember the occupation will not be around us much longer. It has been a generation since the last general history of occupied France, and during that time, scholars have done much research on which Jackson draws. Beginning his history with the formation of the politics and society of the Third Republic, he exposes France's past in all its contradictions and complexities: the Resistance forces' diverse membership, including women, Jews, farm workers and foreigners; the latent forces in French government and culture that allowed for an easy transition to the Vichy government; Marshal P&#x201a;tain's increasing popularity while support for Vichy flagged. In liberated Paris, de Gaulle alleged that the French Republic "never ceased to exist" during occupation. "According to this reinterpretation," writes Jackson, "most of the horrors inflicted on France had been the work of the Germans alone." This insightful, thoroughly researched book will be of interest to scholars and general readers, who will come away with a profound understanding of a crucial time in French history. Jackson does readers a service, for at least another generation. 3 maps. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Basic Biostatistics: Statistics for Public Health Practice</h2><p>Basic Biostatistics is a concise, introductory text that covers biostatistical principles and focuses on the common types of data encountered in public health and biomedical fields.

In the Amores, Ovid addresses himself in a series of elegies to Corinna, his beautiful, elusive mistress. The intimate and vulnerable nature of the poet revealed in these early poems vanishes in the notorious Art of Love, in which he provides a knowing and witty guide to sexual conquest - a work whose alleged obscenity led to Ovid's banishment from Rome in AD 8. This volume also includes the "Cures for Love," with instructions on how to terminate a love affair, and "On Facial Treatment for Ladies," an incomplete poem on the art of cosmetics.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Each book will be a brief, witty, and useful exploration of fiction, nonfiction, or poetry by a writer impassioned by a singular craft issue. The Art Of volumes will provide a series of sustained examinations of key but sometimes neglected aspects of creative writing by some of contemporary literature's finest practioners.</b></p><p>In <i>The Art of Time in Memoir</i>, critic and memoirist Sven Birkerts examines the human impulse to write about the self. By examining memoirs such as Vladimir Nabokov's <i>Speak, Memory</i>; Virginia Woolf's unfinished <i>A Sketch of the Past</i>; and Mary Karr's <i>The Liars' Club</i>, Birkerts describes the memoirist's essential art of assembling patterns of meaning, stirring to life our own sense of past and present.</p></p><p><p><b>Sven Birkerts</b> is the author of <i>Reading Life: Books for the Ages</i>, <i>Readings</i>,<br><i>The Gutenberg Elegies</i>, and a memoir, <i>My Sky Blue Trades</i>. He teaches at Harvard University and at the Bennington Writing Seminars and is the editor of <i>AGNI</i>. He lives in Arlington, Massachusetts.</p>Respected critic Birkerts has written an insightful appreciation of the memoir form, works that occupy a growing... place in our literary culture. Analyzing five ways different writers have chosen to transform their memories into coherent narrative, Birkerts discerns the underlying principle of the memoir form: balancing two perspectives by revisiting significant events in the past to discover a pattern in one's present life. Nabokov, Virginia Woolf and Annie Dillard are what he calls the Lyrical Seekers, who use sensuous apprehension to explore the nature of being. Frank Conroy's <i>Stop-Time</i> is one of the examples of the coming-of-age memoir, as is Birkerts's own <i>My Sky Blue Trades</i>. Fathers and sons, e.g., Paul Auster, Geoffrey Wolff and Blake Morrison, are distinguished from mothers and daughters, e.g., Jamaica Kincaid and Vivian Gornick. Finally, works by Mary Karr and Lucy Grealy are among those illustrating the category of trauma and memory. The appeal of this slim volume lies in Birkert's graceful prose and lucid analysis. Written for the general reader, it artfully conveys the basics of the craft and will be a particular boon to reading groups. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Sadly for his countless admirers, he hitched his own ride to the great beyond much too soon. Culled posthumously from Adams&#x2019;s fleet of beloved Macintosh computers, this selection of essays, articles, anecdotes, and stories offers a fascinating and intimate portrait of the multifaceted artist and absurdist wordsmith. <br><br>Join Adams on an excursion to climb Kilimanjaro . . . dressed in a rhino costume; peek into the private life of Genghis Khan&#x2014;warrior and world-class neurotic; root for the harried author&#x2019;s efforts to get a Hitchhiker movie off the ground in Hollywood; thrill to the further exploits of private eye Dirk Gently and two-headed alien Zaphod Beeblebrox. Though Douglas Adams is gone, he&#x2019;s left us something very special to remember him by. Without a doubt.<br><b><br>&#x201c;Worth reading and even cherishing, if only because it&#x2019;s the last we&#x2019;ll hear from the master of comic science fiction.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The Star-Ledger </i></b></p><p>Adams authored five novels in the Guide, two Dirk Gently novels, and several other books.&#x201c;Above all, of course, Douglas Adams was a transcendent, multi-faceted, comic genius. What made Douglas&#x2019;s work unique, I think, were the wildly contradictory attributes he displayed in his writing. He seamlessly blended world-class intelligence&#x2014;and a daunting knowledge about an impossible variety of subjects (literature, computers, evolution, pop culture, genetics, and music, to name but a few)&#x2014;with transcendental silliness; technophobia with a lust for, and fascination with, every high-tech toy imaginable; deep cynicism about virtually everything with an effusively joyful spirit; and one of the quickest wits on the planet with a relentless perfectionism in pursuing his craft.&#x201d; &#x2014;From the Introduction by Christopher Cerf<br><br>&#x201c;The bottom drawer of recently deceased writers is often best left firmly locked and bolted. In the case of Douglas, I am sure you will agree, the bottom drawer (or in his case, the nested subfolders of his hard drive) has been triumphantly well worth the prising open. There are those who write from time to time and do it well, and then there are Writers. Douglas Adams, and it is pointless to attempt here an explanation or anatomisation, was born, grew up, and remained a Writer to his too-early dying day. <br>&#x201c;You are on the verge of entering the wise, provoking, benevolent, hilarious, and addictive world of Douglas Adams. Don&#x2019;t bolt it all whole&#x2014;as with Douglas&#x2019;s beloved Japanese food, what seems light and easy to assimilate is subtler and more nutritious by far than it might at first appear.&#x201d; &#x2014;Stephen Fry, author of <i>The Liar</i> and <i>Making History: A Novel</i></p><h2>The Dash Diet Action Plan</h2><p>The <i>New York Times</i> Bestseller--Based on the Diet Ranked "#1Best Diet Overall" by US NEWS &amp; WORLD REPORT--for 8 Years in a Row!

Profit from what a visionary group of architects leading this movement has learned about designing new ``small towns&#39;&#39; in Peter Katz&#39;s The New Urbanism. You&#39;ll discover the amazing potential for this kind of work as well as case studies, site plans, project analyses, and 180 beautiful photographs. This unique reference also tackles--and answers--the critical issues of crime, health, traffic, environmental degradation, and economic vitality and opens a startling window on the look and feel of future communities.

So wrote Time Magazine in a recent article about Andres Duany, Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk and Peter Calthorpe, leaders of the dynamic urban design revolution coming to be known as the New Urbanism. Their breakthrough planning conceptspropose a vision of the future that combines the best of the past with the realities and modern conveniences of today. <p>Part of a broader trend toward the restoration of community and concern for a more sustainable environment, the New Urbanism addresses many of the crucial issues of our time: the decline of America's cities, the rebuilding of its crumbling infrastructure, housing affordability, crime and traffic congestion. Not without controversy, the proponents of this new design approach suggest bold alternatives to the present sprawl and isolation that they see as the consequence of five decadesof poorly planned suburban growth. Like the successful older neighborhoods and small towns where many of us grew up, the designs of the New Urbanism integrate housing, shops, workplaces, parks and civil facilities into close-knit communities that are both charming and functional. Walkability is key, but cars aren't excluded.</p><p> Public places lie at the heart of these designs which set aside their most valued sites for parks, schools, churches, meeting halls and other civic uses. Affordability is also an important consideration--a wide range from Seaside, the acclaimed new resort town in Florida's panhandle, to a revitalization plan for the deteriorating core ofdowntown Los Angeles. Also included is a mobile-home village in Arizona (cited by Progressive Architecture in its annual design awards), the rebuilding of the nation's largest "urban renewal" housing project in Texas and a "sustainable community" for 12,000 in British Columbia. </p><p>Initiated by developers, government agencies and/orcitizen advocacy groups, these pioneering new communities and infill projects offer simple yet compelling solutions to many frequently encountered planning problems. The extensively documented case studies in this book include photographs, drawings, diagrams and urban design codes--more than 500 images in all, a majority of which are in color. Essays by the movement's leading practitioners clearly articulate the principles of the New Urbanism. Commentaries by prominent architecture and urban planning theorists complete this comprehensive publication.</p><p>The New Urbanism advocates an ambitious yet pragmatic agenda for the building and rebuilding of our neighborhoods, towns and cities. This book provides an invaluable guide to this emerging movement forarchitects, urban planners, civic leaders and concerned citizens; it is also must reading for anyone who cares about the future of America's communities.</p><b>Peter Katz</b> is a design and marketing consultant based in San Francisco, California, and Seattle, Washington.

Also reproduced are four paintings by Charles Demuth. The essays in Criticism span one hundred years, providing a rich array of perspectives on James and his story. Representing contemporary reactions are pieces by Henry Harland, John D. Barry, Oliver Elton, William Lyon Phelps, and Virginia Woolf. The section also includes landmark criticism by Harold Goddard, Edna Kenton, Edmund Wilson, Katherine Anne Porter, Robert B. Heilman, R. P. Blackmur, Maurice Blanchot, and Leon Edel. Recent, fresh approaches to James's work are presented by Tzvetan Todorov, Shoshana Felman, Henry Sussman, Bruce Robbins, Ned Lukacher, Paul B. Armstrong, and T. J. Lustig. A Chronology and Selected Bibliography are included.</p><p>The story starts conventionally enough with friends sharing ghost stories 'round the fire on Christmas Eve. One of the guests tells about a governess at a country house plagued by supernatural visitors. But in the hands of Henry James, the master of nuance, this little tale of terror is an exquisite gem of sexual and psychological ambiguity. Only the young governess can see the ghosts; only she suspects that the previous governess and her lover are controlling the two orphaned children (a girl and a boy) for some evil purpose. The household staff don't know what she's talking about, the children are evasive when questioned, and the master of the house (the children's uncle) is absent. Why does the young girl claim not to see a perfectly visible woman standing on the far side of the lake? Are the children being deceptive, or is the governess being paranoid? By leaving the questions unanswered, <i>The Turn of Screw</i> generates spine-tingling anxiety in its mesmerized readers.Webster&#x2019;s paperbacks take advantage of the fact that classics are frequently assigned readings in English courses. By using a running English-to-Spanish thesaurus at the bottom of each page, this edition of The Turn of the Screw by Henry James was edited for three audiences.

A brilliant display of erudition, wit, and wisdom, his exploration of how great European writers from Homer to Virginia Woolf depicted reality has taught generations how to read Western literature. This new expanded edition includes a substantial essay in introduction by Edward Said as well as an essay, never before translated into English, in which Auerbach responds to his critics.</p><p>A German Jew, Auerbach was forced out of his professorship at the University of Marburg in 1935. He left for Turkey, where he taught at the state university in Istanbul. There he wrote <i>Mimesis</i>, publishing it in German after the end of the war. Displaced as he was, Auerbach produced a work of great erudition that contains no footnotes, basing his arguments instead on searching, illuminating readings of key passages from his primary texts. His aim was to show how from antiquity to the twentieth century literature progressed toward ever more naturalistic and democratic forms of representation. This essentially optimistic view of European history now appears as a defensive--and impassioned--response to the inhumanity he saw in the Third Reich. Ranging over works in Greek, Latin, Spanish, French, Italian, German, and English, Auerbach used his remarkable skills in philology and comparative literature to refute any narrow form of nationalism or chauvinism, in his own day and ours.</p><p> For many readers, both inside and outside the academy, <i>Mimesis</i> is among the finest works of literary criticism ever written.</p></p><p><p>"To describe <i>Mimesis</i> as a classic is to offer something of a dismissive understatement, which conveys nothing of the excitement of this book, as fresh and direct, as untechnical, as when it first appeared. To say that it constitutes virtually a history of Western literature is to omit adding that it writes that history in a way that is still new and stimulating, with nothing of the manual about it, a synchronic kind of history with which we are only just now catching up. It is also important to stress the novel relationship Auerbach establishes between sentence or syntax and narrative form; and the world-wide democratic perspective in which he framed his work which has only become visible since globalization. <i>Mimesis</i> is certainly one of the half dozen most important literary-critical works of the twentieth century."<b>--Fredric R. Jameson</b></p> <p>"Written in exile, from what Auerbach called with grave irony his 'incomparable historical vantage point,' <i>Mimesis</i> is a magnificent achievement. For me, as for many others, this hugely ambitious, wise account of the representation of reality in Western literature, at once a celebration and a lament, is one of the essential works of literary criticism."<b>--Stephen Greenblatt</b></p> <p>"Every student of literature should know <i>Mimesis</i>, arguably the single greatest work of 20th-century criticism. How do writers--from Homer and Dante to Stendhal and Virginia Woolf--depict the world? To explore this question, Erich Auerbach brings to bear the authority of truly encyclopedic learning and the persuasiveness of a supple, humane literary intelligence. Yes, <i>Mimesis</i> is magisterial, but it is also thrilling to read, inspiring, and more relevant than ever: A masterpiece."<b>--Michael Dirda</b></p><b>Erich Auerbach</b>, before his death in 1957, was Sterling Professor of Romance Languages at Yale University.</p><h2>Continental Philosophy since 1750: The Rise and Fall of the Self (A History of Western Philosophy, Vol. 7) (History of Western Philosophy, 7)</h2><p>The flowering of creative and speculative philosophy that emerged in modern Europe--particularly in Germany--is a thrilling adventure story as well as an essential chapter in the history of philosophy.

The Self in question is no ordinary self; it is the Transcendental Self, whose nature and ambitions are unprecedentedly arrogant, cosmic, and often obscure.

I wanted to break away from the traditional tales about magic and find roots in the soil around me. What would magic look like if it sprang up in the small towns of America? And what in the world would it be called if I didn't want to call that distinctive know-how magic? I enjoyed setting Savvy in our ordinary, everyday world, and filling it with larger-than-life characters who have very normal, human reactions and fears. </p> <b>Q: Do you have a distinctive talent, trait or "savvy" of your own? </b> <p> <b>A:</b> With a savvy, there is always the element of the ideal versus the reality-what you dream about versus what you get. If I could pick, my savvy would probably be the ability to fly or to breathe underwater. But if I were to declare what my real, true, everyday savvy is, I think that I would have to say that I smile a lot, even through rough times. And I tend to spill things-usually on my shirt at dinner parties! </p> <b>Q: What was your family like growing up? </b> <p> <b>A:</b> Growing up, my family consisted of a mom, a dad, an older sister, a few (dozen) rabbits, numerous hamsters, gerbils, several birds, and a goldfish that lived about twelve centuries in goldfish years. I didn't have a big family like the Beaumonts, but we did have our own share of unusual attributes, and my sister and I were always encouraged to follow our hearts and explore our talents. </p> <b>Q: Are any of your characters based on you or your family? </b> <p> <b>A:</b> I think it might be impossible not to put a tiny bit of oneself into at least a few characters. Like Samson, I prefer solitude. Like Lester, I tend to twitch. Like Lill, I often feel big and small at the same time. And like Mibs, I still struggle to weed out other people's voices from my head. </p> <b>Q: Savvy is your first novel. What would you be doing if you weren't writing? </b> <p> <b>A:</b> I'd be worrying more! I think that anxiety is simply an active imagination put to the wrong use. I try to redirect all of the 'What-If's' of worrying into the 'What-If's' of storytelling. </p> <b>Q: Where do you write? </b> <p> <b>A:</b> I have an overstuffed chair that's big enough for me to sit in cross-legged and pull a laptop table up to when I write. It's like a nest. It's my favorite place in the house. </p>2008 Boston Globe-Horn Book honor</p><h2>Materials Selection in Mechanical Design</h2><p><p>Understanding materials, their properties and behavior is fundamental to engineering design, and a key application of materials science.

"The emotions in which Scott excels are not those of human beings pitted against other human beings, but of man pitted against<br>Nature, of man in relation to fate.

This is the currently used textbook for &#34;Probabilistic Systems Analysis,&#34; an introductory probability course at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, attended by a large number of undergraduate and graduate students. The book covers the fundamentals of probability theory (probabilistic models, discrete and continuous random variables, multiple random variables, and limit theorems), which are typically part of a first course on the subject. It also contains, a number of more advanced topics, from which an instructor can choose to match the goals of a particular course. These topics include transforms, sums of random variables, least squares estimation, the bivariate normal distribution, and a fairly detailed introduction to Bernoulli, Poisson, and Markov processes. The book strikes a balance between simplicity in exposition and sophistication in analytical reasoning. Some of the more mathematically rigorous analysis has been just intuitively explained in the text, but is developed in detail (at the level of advanced calculus) in the numerous solved theoretical problems. The book has been widely adopted for classroom use in introductory probability courses within the USA and abroad.</p><p>The authors are Professors in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

But many of us feel discouraged to practice because we see young, slim, flexible, well, and able-bodied people dominating yoga spaces. Yet, yoga is truly a practice for all--conferring enormous benefits to our overall well-being as our bodies change, age, and navigate various health challenges. Jivana Heyman, founder of Accessible Yoga, views yoga as a basic human right--saying we all deserve to practice it in whatever state we find our body or mind. <i>Accessible Yoga</i> offers a simple, clear, and wonderfully adaptable practice for all people regardless of ability, health, and body type. Heyman has spent over twenty years sharing yoga with people of all abilities and backgrounds, and in this book, he shares his knowledge by breaking down complex yoga poses, breathing practices, meditation techniques, and yoga teachings into clearly understandable and practical tools we can use every day, regardless of our limitations or challenges.</p><p>JIVANA HEYMAN, C-IAYT, E-RYT500, is the founder and director of Accessible Yoga, an international non-profit organization dedicated to increasing access to the yoga teachings for people of all abilities and backgrounds.

Whether you are thick or thin, young or old, ambulatory or need the assistance of a walker, wheelchair, or crutch, Jivana opens up the practice of yoga in the most delightful and creative ways to anyone who can breathe. Through offering progressive points of entry&#x2014;from free standing, using a wall, sitting in a chair, or lying on the floor or even in bed&#x2014;<i>Accessible Yoga</i> is a treasure trove of invaluable and practical information that will open many doors for people who might otherwise not have the courage to begin.

Comparing modern art not only to pizzas but also to traditional and children's art, Heller shows us how we can refine analytical tools we already possess to understand and enjoy even the most unfamiliar paintings and sculptures.</p><br><p> How is a painting like a pizza? Both depend on visual balance for much of their overall appeal and, though both can be judged by a set of established standards, pizzas and paintings must ultimately be evaluated in terms of individual taste. By using such commonsense examples and making unexpected connections, this book helps even the most skeptical viewers feel comfortable around contemporary art and see aspects of it they would otherwise miss. Heller discusses how nontraditional works of art are made--and thus how to talk about their composition and formal elements. She also considers why such art is made and what it "means."</p><br><p> At the same time, Heller reassures those of us who have felt uncomfortable around avant-garde art that we don't have to <i>like</i> all--or even any--of it. Yet, if we can relax, we can use the aesthetic awareness developed in everyday life to analyze almost any painting, sculpture, or installation. Heller also gives concise answers to the eight questions she is most frequently asked about contemporary art--from how to tell when an abstract painting is right side up to which works of art belong in a museum.</p><br><p> This book is for anyone who agrees with art critic Clement Greenberg that "All profoundly original art looks ugly at first." It's also for anyone who disagrees. It is for anyone who wants to get more out of a museum or gallery visit and would like to be able to say something more than just "yes" or "no" when asked if they like an artist's work.</p></p><p><p>"Nearly a century after the Armory Show, avant-garde art remains misunderstood by mainstream America. In a practical, industrious country where the fine arts have never been deeply rooted, abstract and conceptual artists are still too often dismissed as silly, untalented, or immoral, with art galleries portrayed as snobbish and greedy. This worsening cultural crisis affects private and public funding, discourages promising new voices, and threatens America's creative future. Nancy G. Heller's wonderful book arrives in the nick of time. Destined to be a classic of public education, it is lucid, engaging, and ingenious, leading the reader through the difficulties and strategies of avant-garde art. Intended for the general audience, the book is also must reading for teachers throughout the humanities, which have become distracted by jargon and ideology. Heller is an inspiring role model for university scholars, who must recover and renew their central mission of teaching."<b>--Camille Paglia, University Professor and Professor of Humanities, University of the Art</b></p><p>"This delightful, down-to-earth guide demystifies the act of looking at modern and contemporary art with clarity and humor, drawing upon a diverse and wide-ranging array of artworks, which are abundantly reproduced. It will definitely appeal to novice viewers perplexed by the enigmas of earthworks and the splatters, scrapes, and splashes of non-traditional art, and it just may convince a few skeptics to look for beauty in unexpected places. <i>Why a Painting is Like a Pizza</i> is an ideal book for beginners because Nancy Heller leads us through the basics of analyzing the elements of any work of art while sharing tales of her own, often humorous, peregrinations to museums and galleries. She is an ideal companion---full of fun, facts, genuine enthusiasm, and a healthy respect for viewers abilities and their personal responses."<b>--Bay Hallowell, Coordinator of Special Projects, Youth, and Family Programs, Philadelphia Museum of Art</b></p><p>"Nancy Heller has wrought a minor miracle. She has written a book about art that is of interest to both the layperson and the professional. <i>Why a Painting Is Like a Pizza</i> is informative and highly entertaining. By exploring the context within which art is made and exhibited, and by probing the criteria for evaluating it, Heller has constructed a useful framework for looking at art meaningfully. Without belittling artists and their work, she has demystified the artistic process. Through her pragmatic, everyday analogies she helps us see that all art is an act of communication and that the visitor's response--whatever it might be--is valid."<b>--Susan S. Badder, Curator of Education, Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.</b></p><p>"Reading <i>Why a Painting is Like a Pizza</i> is like having a personal guide at your side as you make your way through unfamiliar territory. We feel that we are in a gallery, engaged in an engrossing conversation with somebody who knows a great deal about modern art, but does not pretend to know all the answers, or even believe that answers are always available. While we hear Nancy Heller's highly intelligent and often very witty voice throughout the entire book, we also hear our own, for the author seems to know what we are thinking, wondering, and even resisting before we have been able to put our questions and doubts into words. "<b>--Linda Andre, Program Specialist for Teacher Services, The Sylvia Friedberg Nachlas Endowed Chair in Museum Education, Department of Education &amp; Interpretation, The Baltimore Museum of Art</b></p><p>"So much writing on modern art is dessicated intellectualism, jargon laden, and marinated in theory. Here, instead, we have a simple and clear presentation, truly accessible to students, general readers, and museum beginners."<b>--A. Richard Turner, author of <i>Inventing Leonardo</i></b></p><b>Nancy G. Heller</b> is Professor of Art History at The University of the Arts in Philadelphia. The author of <i>Women Artists: An Illustrated History</i> and <i>Women Artists: Works from the National Museum of Women in the Arts</i>, Heller has received awards from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Smithsonian Institution.</p><h2>The Philosophy of Rhetoric (Galaxy Books)</h2><p>Our communication is limitedby misunderstanding. Rhetoric, as Professor Richards defines it, is the study of misunderstanding and its remedies. The conventional rules of the old rhetoric and the formulations of scientific language have narrow application to conversational speech; Professor Richard&#39;s definition of rhetoric is based on a practical question: how do words work in discourse? To answer this question, he examines the interaction of words with each other and with their contexts, showing how a continual synthesis of meaning, or &#34;principle of metaphor&#34;, gives life to discussion. It is through comprehension of the way meaning changes in discourse that we can better control and animate our use of words, and so decrease misunderstanding.</p><p>Ivor Armstrong Richards (1893-1979) was an influential literary critic and rhetorician."Chosen largely to present the philosophy of language informing [Richards's] approach....Should stimulate thoughtful re-examinations of our own positions on the important issues Richards addresses."--Freshman English News<br><br>"Masterful (and manageable)....Has long been needed."-D.G.

Clear and to the point, Richards illuminates the place rhetoric occupies in human societies."--Dr. William O. Boggs, Slippery Rock University</p><h2>Jung on Synchronicity and the Paranormal</h2><p><p>C. G. Jung had a lifelong interest in the paranormal that culminated in his influential theory of synchronicity. Combining extracts taken from the <i>Collected Works</i>; letters; the autobiographical <i>Memories, Dreams, Reflections; </i>and transcripts of seminars, <i>Jung on Synchronicity and the Paranormal</i> sets out clearly his seminal contribution to our understanding of this controversial area.</p><br><p> In his introduction, Roderick Main discusses Jung's encounters with and observations of the paranormal, the influences that contributed to his theory of synchronicity, and the central ideas of the theory itself. The selections include Jung's writings on mediumistic trance phenomena, spirits and hauntings, anomalous events in the development and practice of analytical psychology, and the divinatory techniques of astrology and the <i>I Ching</i>. The book also features Jung's most lucid account of his theory in the form of his short essay "On Synchronicity," and a number of Jung's less-known writings on parapsychology, his astrological experiment, and the relationship between mind and body.</p><br><br><p> <i>Jung on Synchronicity and the Paranormal</i> addresses subjects that were fundamental to Jung's personal and professional development. Probing deeply into the theory of synchronicity, Roderick Main clarifies issues that have long been a source of confusion to Jung's readers.</p></p><p><b>Roderick Main</b> is a Visiting Professor at the Centre for Psychoanalytic Studies, University of Essex.</p><h2>The Two Gentlemen of Verona (Folger Shakespeare Library)</h2><p>While the word &#x201c;gentlemen&#x201d; suggests that its heroes are adults, <i>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</i> is more intelligible if we think of them as boys, leaving home for the first time.

When he was eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway. The couple had three children&#x2014;an older daughter Susanna and twins, Judith and Hamnet. Hamnet, Shakespeare&#x2019;s only son, died in childhood. The bulk of Shakespeare&#x2019;s working life was spent in the theater world of London, where he established himself professionally by the early 1590s. He enjoyed success not only as a playwright and poet, but also as an actor and shareholder in an acting company. Although some think that sometime between 1610 and 1613 Shakespeare retired from the theater and returned home to Stratford, where he died in 1616, others believe that he may have continued to work in London until close to his death.<br><br>Barbara A.

At 3M, teams are critical to meeting the company's goal of producing half of each year's revenues from the previous five years' innovations. Kodak's Zebra Team proved the worth of black-and-white film manufacturing in a world where color is king.<br><br>But many companies overtook the potential of teams in turning around tagging profits, entering new markets, and making exciting innovations happen -- because they don't know how to utilize teams successfully. Authors Jon R. Katzenbach and Douglas K. Smith talked with hundreds of people in more than thirty companies to find out where and how teams work best and how to enhance their effectiveness. They reveal:<br><br>The most important element in team success<br>Who excels at team leadership ... and why they are rarely the most senior people<br>Why companywide change depends on teams ... and more<br><br>Comprehensive and proven effective, <i>The Wisdom of Teams</i> is the classic primer on making teams a powerful tool for success in today's global marketplace.<br></p><p>Jon R. Katzenbach has been with McKinsey &amp; Company, Inc. for more than three decades, and since the mid-1980's has led the firm's worldwide organization performance and change practice.The importance of teams has become a cliche of modern business theory, but few have a clear idea of what it means. In this new edition of their best-selling primer, Katzenbach and Smith try to impart some analytical rigor to the concept. Drawing on their experience as management consultants and a plethora of case studies at companies like Burlington Northern and Motorola, they cover such topics as the optimal size of teams, coping with turnover in team personnel and nurturing "extraordinary teams" rather than "pseudo-teams." Reacting against the touchy-feely interpersonal bent of discourse on teams, they emphasize hard-nosed principles of "performance, focus, and discipline," over the softer concerns of "communication, openness and 'chemistry.'" Teams, they argue, gel and achieve not by developing "togetherness," but by tackling and surmounting specific "outcome-based" challenges ("eliminate all late deliveries...within 90 days" rather than the vaguer "develop a plan for improving customer satisfaction."). Some of the authors' recommendations are reasonably precise and practical, but too many are nebulous truisms ("keep the purpose, goals, and approach relevant and meaningful") or weighed down by turgid consultant-ese ("integrating the performance goals of formal, structural units as well as special ad hoc group efforts becomes a significant process design challenge"). The case studies are better written, but it's not clear that these inspiring anecdotes of team triumph add up to a systematic doctrine. The book leaves the impression that teams ultimately just have to learn by doing. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Greenhouse and Hoophouse Grower&#39;s Handbook: Organic Vegetable Production Using Protected Culture</h2><p><p><strong>Best practices for the eight most profitable crops</strong></p> <p>Today only a few dozen large-scale producers dominate the greenhouse produce market.

First serial, The New Yorker.</p><p>Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Saul Bellow confined himself to shorter fictions. Not that this old master ever dabbled in minimalism: novellas such as <i>The Actual</i> and <i>The Bellarosa Connection</i> are bursting at the seams with wit, plot, and the intellectual equivalent of high fiber. Still, Bellow's readers wondered if he would ever pull another full-sized novel from his hat. With <i>Ravelstein</i>, the author has done just that--and he proves that even in his ninth decade, he can pin a character to the page more vividly, and more permanently, than just about anybody on the planet.<p> Character is very much the issue in <i>Ravelstein</i>, whose eponymous subject is a thinly disguised version of Bellow's boon companion, the late Allan Bloom. Like Bloom, Abe Ravelstein has spent much of his career at the University of Chicago, fighting a rearguard action against the creeping boobism and vulgarity of American life. What's more, he's written a surprise bestseller (a ringer, of course, for <i>The Closing of the American Mind</i>), which has made him into a millionaire. And finally, he's dying--has died of AIDS, in fact, six years before the opening of the novel. What we're reading, then, is a faux memoir by his best friend and anointed Boswell, a Bellovian body-double named Chick: </p><blockquote> Ravelstein was willing to lay it all out for me. Now why did he bother to tell me such things, this large Jewish man from Dayton, Ohio? Because it very urgently needed to be said. He was HIV-positive, he was dying of complications from it. Weakened, he became the host of an endless list of infections. Still, he insisted on telling me over and over again what love was--the neediness, the awareness of incompleteness, the longing for wholeness, and how the pains of Eros were joined to the most ecstatic pleasures. </blockquote> <i>Ravelstein</i> is a little thin in the plot department--or more accurately, it has an anti-plot, which consists of Chick's inability to write his memoir. But seldom has a case of writer's block been so supremely productive. The narrator dredges up anecdote after anecdote about his subject, assembling a composite portrait: "In approaching a man like Ravelstein, a piecemeal method is perhaps best." We see this <i>very</i> worldly philosopher teaching, kvetching, eating, drinking, and dying, the last in melancholic increments. His death, and Chick's own brush with what Henry James called "the distinguished thing," give much of the novel a kind of black-crepe coloration. But fortunately, Bellow shares Ravelstein's "Nietzschean view, favorable to comedy and bandstands," and there can't be many eulogies as funny as this one. <p> As always, the author is lavish with physical detail, bringing not only his star but a large gallery of minor players to rude and resounding life ("Rahkmiel was a non-benevolent Santa Claus, a dangerous person, ruddy, with a red-eyed scowl and a face in which the anger muscles were highly developed"). His sympathies are also stretched in some interesting directions by his homosexual protagonist. Bellow hasn't, to be sure, transformed himself into an affirmative-action novelist. But his famously capacious view of human nature has been enriched by this additional wrinkle: "In art you become familiar with due process. You can't simply write people off or send them to hell." A world-class portrait, a piercing intimation of mortality, <i>Ravelstein</i> is truly that <i>other</i> distinguished thing: a great novel. <i>--James Marcus</i></p>Our 'greatest living novelist' [Jonathan Yardley, The Washington Post] returns with his first full-length novel in years. <p> "Simply the best writer we have" </p><p> -The New York Times Book Review </p><p> "No contemporary of ours is more consistently brilliant and more defiantly risky than Saul Bellow" </p><p> - Joyce Carol Oates, The New York Times Book Review </p><p> "His voice has the meticulous range and certainty of a cathedral choir.

Stallman</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.The Red Badge of Courage was published in 1895, when its author, an impoverished writer living a bohemian life in New York, was only twenty-three. It immediately became a bestseller, and Stephen Crane became famous. Crane set out to create "a psychological portrayal of fear." Henry Fleming, a Union Army volunteer in the Civil War, thinks "that perhaps in a battle he might run....As far as war was concerned he knew nothing of himself." And he does run in his first battle, full of fear and then remorse. He encounters a grotesquely rotting corpse propped against a tree, and a column of wounded men, one of whom is a friend who dies horribly in front of him. Fleming receives his own "red badge" when a fellow soldier hits him in the head with a gun. "The idea of falling like heroes on ceremonial battlefields," Ford Madox Ford remarked later, "was gone forever."

Huntington</b> is the Albert J. Weatherhead III University Professor at Harvard and chairman of the Harvard Academy for International and Area Studies. He is the author or editor of a dozen other books.<p> As at so many other critical junctures in recent history -- during the Vietnam War, at the height of the soul-searching that followed, as the Cold War drew to a close -- Samuel P. Huntington has written a book that poses some of the most critical questions facing our nation. The epochal change before us now is globalization, and Huntington is as penetrating as ever in his assessment of the challenges it creates -- challenges, he shrewdly sees, that go far beyond the economic. What distinguishes America, or any nation for that matter, in a shrinking world where international frontiers mean less and less? How can a people already preoccupied with ethnic identity absorb and acculturate the millions of immigrants being driven to our shores by global economics? And how in the long run will America cohere if everyone feels they belong to a minority?</p><p> Who Are We? tackles these questions with passionate intensity. As Huntington argues, nations "come and go," and a strong sense of "national consciousness" is surely critical to America's success or failure. It's all the more disappointing, then, that Who Are We? slips far too often into paranoid threat-mongering instead of honestly weighing the quandaries of the newly globalizing American nation. And its proposed solution for the United States -- an insular, "Anglo-Protestant" cultural fortress -- seems a poor road map indeed for navigating the new world ahead.</p><p> The strongest part of the book is its premise: that nationality matters -- and that, despite the universalism central to our values, America is different from other countries. In Huntington's view, this distinctiveness is based in "culture," by which he means neither Walt Whitman nor MTV, but rather a shared sense of community and common mores, including the premium we put on individualism, the work ethic, the gospel of success and an often crusading moralism. One can quarrel with some of the elements he thinks are central -- most important, a single, shared religion -- but plainly Huntington is on to something. Hard as it may be for us to define what it means to be American, people the world over know it when they see it, and we lose touch with it at our peril.</p><p> Where Huntington goes wrong, first of all, is in diagnosing the threats to this culture. Concerned that many Americans do not grasp the urgency of the issue, he piles on chapter after anxious chapter documenting potential dangers. Some of his points are well taken, though familiar enough: alarums about affirmative action, bilingual education, dual citizenship and the like. The problem even here, where he is on most solid ground, is that Huntington can't seem to see anything but bad news -- can't grasp, for example, how multiculturalism has ebbed since Sept. 11, or the way some apparently disturbing trends like dual citizenship are more symbolic than real and paradoxically can boost national cohesion, in this case by easing the way for many immigrants to become American citizens. Worse still, in other instances, convinced by his own conjecture that a trend could pose a threat, Huntington badly distorts the evidence or masks it with overheated speculation.</p><p> The most misleading chapters are those that deal with Hispanic immigrants. In Huntington's nightmare vision, we are headed for a "bilingual, bicultural society," where Latinos take over some states, Anglos retreat to others, most of our big cities look like the barrios of Los Angeles and U.S. foreign policy is dictated in Mexico City. Huntington is not wrong that today's Latino influx differs in many ways from previous immigrant waves: the sheer number coming from a single non-English speaking region, for example, and the way modern communications make it easier to maintain ties to the Old Country. But existing evidence about Hispanic assimilation simply does not support his apocalyptic fears -- as he himself often lets on in the fine print under an inflammatory topic sentence. Newly arrived Latinos are among the most patriotic Americans -- enlisting, for instance, in record numbers and now dying bravely in Iraq. For all the fulminations of a few angry activists, there is no evidence that the majority harbor irredentist designs on the Southwest or do not want their children to become full Americans. Study after study shows that virtually everyone in the second generation grows up proficient in English, and by the third generation, two-thirds speak only English.</p><p> But arguably even more wrong-headed is the prescriptive half of the book: a long, fervent historically based case that America is inherently an Anglo-Protestant nation and that we cannot hope to flourish unless we embrace that definition. Huntington argues convincingly -- and who can doubt? -- that the soil in which America's distinctive culture first took root was both English and dissenting. The earliest settlers' values still do much to color ours, and the "American Creed" that unites us politically -- our belief in freedom, tolerance, equal opportunity, the rule of law and the like -- is plainly a product of the British Enlightenment. But to say that our national character is Anglo-Protestant is to mistake origins for essence.</p><p> Huntington's selective history leaves out the critical ways in which early Americans revised and repudiated their Anglo inheritance -- most fundamentally with the separation of church and state and their rejection of the class-based hierarchies that bind British society. The result was a radically new nation based on a universalist conception of man and open to anyone -- including, over time, tens of millions of non-Anglo immigrants. Despite persistent fears much like those Huntington voices today, these newcomers and their children invariably became Americans. The very act of living in a free, democratic society ensures this outcome by rewarding the habits of the heart -- the quick pursuit of opportunity, self-sufficiency, the work ethic and the like -- that Huntington identifies as American culture. True, each successive wave added a distinctive flavor to the mix: new food, new music, new ways of approaching family, fun and even politics. But the newcomers made little dent in the essential core of what it means to be American: Their sectarian, communal identities have always given way to tolerant individualism, for example, and even those from the most authoritarian societies have eventually embraced our egalitarianism. Still, to claim that this core remains Anglo-Protestant only distorts its distinctiveness. It is also to exaggerate the challenges that immigration and ethnicity pose.</p><p> In the end, what's most disturbing about Who Are We? is its lack of confidence in the power of American identity. It's as if Huntington can't believe that our tolerant, universalist spirit could possibly stand up to an old-fashioned, ethnic nationalism of the kind that, say, today's Mexican immigrants arrive with. And, as a result, he needs to define our diffuse, big-tent essence down to the narrow orthodoxies of a more easily grasped culture, like Anglo-Protestantism. Of course, he's entitled to his fears and his pessimism, but it's a sorry approach for a self-styled "patriot" proposing to chart America's way into the global future. </p><p> </p><p>Reviewed by Tamar Jacoby</p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

This will shed greater light on the developments in the history of philosophy and better prepare us for the intellectual challenges of our time. The fall of Adam brought intellectual as well as moral corruption on the human race, and the effects of the fall can be seen in the work of philosophers, most of whom try to understand the world autonomously&#x2014;through reasoning apart from God's revelation. Some philosophers have appealed to God's revelation, but their work has often been compromised with the wisdom of the world. Revelation should inform reason, and not the other way round. In the past, even Christian theology was corrupted by the movement toward intellectual autonomy, creating the tradition of liberalism, which has unhappily dominated academic theology down to the present day. But there is hope&#x2014;a new generation of Christian thinkers take God's Word seriously. Frame's unique new contribution augments that process.</p><p><b>John M. Frame</b> (A.B., Princeton University; B.D., Westminster Theological Seminary; M.A. and M.Phil., Yale University; D.D., Belhaven College) is the J. D. Trimble Professor of Systematic Theology and Philosophy at Reformed Theological Seminary in Orlando and the author of many books, including the four-volume Theology of Lordship series."John Frame has done it again! In the lucid and comprehensive style of his Theology of Lordship volumes, he here presents a full overview of Western thought about knowledge of God as it must appear to all who receive Holy Scripture, as he does, as the record, product, and present reality of God speaking. And the solid brilliance of the narrative makes it a most effective advocacy for the Kuyper-Van Til perspective that in a well-digested form it represents. It is a further outstanding achievement by John Frame. The book deserves wide use as a textbook, and I hope it will achieve that. My admiration for John's work grows and grows." --<b>J. I. Packer</b>, Board of Governors' Professor of Theology, Regent College, Vancouver, British Columbia<br><br>"Few in our day champion a vision of God that is as massive, magnificent, and biblical as John Frame's. For decades, he has given himself to the church, to his students, and to meticulous thinking and the rigorous study of the Bible. He has winsomely, patiently, and persuasively contended for the gospel in the secular philosophical arena, as well as in the thick of the church worship wars and wrestlings with feminism and open theism. He brings together a rare blend of big-picture thinking, levelheaded reflection, biblical fidelity, a love for the gospel and the church, and the ability to write with care and clarity." --<b>John Piper</b>, Founder and Teacher, desiringGod.org; Chancellor, Bethlehem College and Seminary, Minneapolis<br><br>"When I was a young man, I plowed through Bertrand Russell's 1945 classic, <i>A History of Western Philosophy</i>. A couple of years ago I read the much shorter (and more interesting) work of Luc Ferry, <i>A Brief History of Thought</i>. Between these two I have become familiar with many histories of Western thought, each written out of deep commitments, some acknowledged, some not. But I have never read a history of Western thought quite like John Frame's. Professor Frame unabashedly tries to think through sources and movements out of the framework (bad pun intended) of deep-seated Christian commitments, and invites his readers to do the same. These commitments, combined with the format of a seminary or college textbook, will make this work invaluable to students and pastors who tire of ostensible neutrality that is no more neutral than the next volume. Agree or disagree with some of his arguments, but John Frame will teach you how to think in theological and philosophical categories." --<b>D. A.

In the mid-nineteenth century, the movement took off, changing how Americans thought about religion, literature, the natural world, class distinctions, the role of women, and the existence of slavery.<br>Edited by the eminent scholar Lawrence Buell, this comprehensive anthology contains the essential writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Margaret Fuller, and their fellow visionaries.

Cabot Professor of American Literature at Harvard University. He is the award-winning author of many notable books, including Literary Transcendentalism, The Environmental Imagination, and Emerson.1.<br><br> Mary Moody Emerson<br><br> Letters to a Future Transcendentalist<br><br> (1817--51)<br> Mary Moody Emerson (1774-1863) was Ralph Waldo Emerson's aunt and first mentor. She was a striking figure in her own right. She impressed all who came into contact with her--which included most of the Transcendentalist circle--with her unsystematic brilliance, her spiritual intensity, her biting wit, and her eccentric force. The younger sister of Emerson's father, she became the family matriarch after his early death. She had high hopes that Ralph Waldo would distinguish himself in the ministerial career that the men in his family had pursued for six unbroken generations back to colonial times. She wound up driving him toward Transcendentalism even as she tried to warn him away.<br><br> The many letters she sent him over more than forty years display her unique talents. They led Emerson, astonishingly, to praise her as one of the great prose stylists of her day, although she wrote almost nothing for publication. Both of them relished their correspondence. Many of Mary Emerson's turns of thought and even her turns of phrase resurface in his own later essays. They took a similar delight in the natural world, in ranging widely through Asian as well as western thought and literature, in moral and spiritual inquiry, and in a headlong free-associative style of thought and expression.<br><br> Here are a dozen passages from Mary's letters to her nephew, starting with a comically extravagant letter of congratulation upon the start of his freshman year at Harvard at the tender but then typical age of fourteen. Often she responds pointedly to his own letters and compositions, from a juvenile proposal for "reform" of drama through high-minded literary criticism (item 4) to major work like his 1838 Divinity School Address (item 11), which took her aback, as it did most of his elders. Mary's oblique reflection on the controversy, her fable of Urah, may have suggested Emerson's poem "Uriel" (see Section V-B below).<br><br> Too conservative to approve of Waldo's Transcendental turn, Mary Emerson nonetheless helped set him--and the movement--on the way. But no matter how famous he became, she never ceased to admonish him when she thought he deserved it. Her charge that wealth was a topic unworthy of him (item 12) is a prime example.<br><br> SOURCE: The Selected Letters of Mary Moody Emerson, ed. Nancy Craig Simmons.

He showed us some fine representations of the incarnation of Vishnoo. They are much akin to Grecian fable--and from his representation I believe the incarnations to be much like the doctrine of transmigration. At bottom of the histories of the incarnations is often the doctrine of the universal presence &amp; agency of One God. . . .<br><br> As to books, I've been only where you have, sometimes in Merlin's cave and Homer's shades, sometimes.

The difficulty remains the same when I struggle with the extension of never never never--just as I repeated the exercise in childhood: cant form an idea, cant stretch myself to that which has no end. It may be owing to the limits of childhood repeating the idea &amp; wishing to come at an end in vain. . . . It is this impossibility of losing oneself, tho' ages pass over the change, that argues immortality.

But after all I do appear so to other folks, when under the influence of the indifference I feel to society (or somthing worse) with the extreme pleasure of wittnessing their fine things.

If the bible is a fable I would cherish it now in age with undying zeal--It may have a truth of infinite weight like other fables which have a little. But it is not a fable I know. It answers to the living consciousness of God's impress on the soul. It develops the divinity within. Not the poetic gospelless divinity of German idealism--whose baseless fabrick will vanish into thin air.

And I may ask what you mean by speaking of "a great truth whose authority you would feel as its own"? In the letter of Dec 25 you [write] "whether the heart were not the Creator." Now if this withering Lucifer doctrine of pantheism be true, what moral truth can you preach or by what authority should you feel it? Without a personal God you are on an ocean mast unrigged for any port or object. Then why not continue to preach--&amp; pray too? Where is the truth, so infinitely weighty with the true theist, injured? Some body must keep up these idle institutions &amp; they may keep men from jail and gallows. What better scope for the intellectual reservoir? And such has been your integrity, whenever I have been indulged with hearing or reading, what St Paul, who had the fullest convictions of Jesus being the only medium of communication with the Incomprehensible, would not tax your sincerity, tho' he would regret the different character you assigned.

Along with Thomas Carlyle, he was more influential in interpreting German thought for American audiences than any other early-nineteenth-century British writer. A prime example is Coleridge's restatement of the Kantian distinction between "Reason" and "Understanding," in the face of the prevailing Anglo-American view, which rested on John Locke's contention that all knowledge is derived empirically, from sense experience. In Locke's view, reason and understanding were synonymous. Coleridge prepared the way for the Transcendentalist conception of Reason as a power of mind or soul that enables a person to grasp divine or Transcendent truth intuitively. (Ironically, Kant himself had explicitly denied the human mind such power. Such are the vagaries of intellectual history.) Coleridge's distinction reached most Transcendentalists through the American edition of his Aids to Reflection (1829), edited by Vermont Calvinist James Marsh (1794-1842). This indeed was "the decisive event in establishing respect" for Coleridge "as a thinker," as the authoritative modern scholarly edition of Aids declares. Marsh's prefatory remarks chastised Locke and seconded the importance of the Reason-Understanding distinction in ways that prompted both foes and friends to lump Marsh with the Transcendentalists--to his acute irritation.<br><br> SOURCE: Aids to Reflection, ed. James Marsh. Burlington, Vermont: Chauncey Goodrich, 1829. Reprinted from the original English edition of 1825.<br><br> Reason is the Power of universal and necessary Convictions, the Source and Substance of Truths above Sense, and having their evidence in themselves. . . . Contemplated distinctively in reference to formal (or abstract) truth, it is the speculative Reason; but in reference to actual (or moral) truth, as the fountain of ideas and the Light of the Conscience, we name it the Practical Reason. Whenever by self-subjection to this universal Light, the Will of the Individual, the particular Will, has become a Will of Reason, the man is regenerate: and Reason is then the Spirit of the regenerated man, whereby the Person is capable of a quickening inter-communication with the Divine Spirit. . . .<br><br> On the other hand, the Judgments of the Understanding are binding only in relation to the objects of our Senses, which we reflect under the forms of the Understanding. . . .<br><br> To apply these remarks for our present purpose, we have only to describe Understanding and Reason, each by its characteristic qualities.

Famous for its frank portrayal of life in Brooklyn&#x2019;s ethnic neighborhoods and Miller&#x2019;s outrageous sexual exploits, <i>The Tropic of Capricorn</i> is now considered a cornerstone of modern literature.<br><br></p><p><br>Henry Valentine Miller was born in 1891 in New York City and spent most of his life in Brooklyn, Paris, and Big Sur, California. His books include Tropic of Cancer, Tropic of Capricorn, the Rosy Crucifixion trilogy (Sexus, Plexus, and Nexus), Black Spring, and Crazy Cock. He died in 1980.Campbell Scott might possibly be a narrative dead-ringer for the eponymous protagonist in Henry Miller&#39;s semi-autobiographical TROPIC OF CAPRICORN. Scott&#39;s dry, languorous, and lovely voice, which he uses for most of this book, hits all of Miller&#39;s cynical but observant notes as he describes the great muddle and mess of humanity around him in New York City during the 1920s. Most of the time Scott sounds almost apathetic, mimicking the distant, disenchanted tone of Miller. Yet, besides all the derogatory adjectives that can be thrown at Miller--misogynist, misanthrope, depressed artist--the writer was also ebullient, mystical, and euphoric. Scott, however, captures this side of Miller barely at all, to the detriment of this production.

When her husband drinks himself to death, Sarah, a dirt-poor homemaker with no family to rely on and the note on the farm long past due, must find a way for her and young Emerson Bridge to survive. But the more daunting obstacle is Sarah's fear that her mother's words, seared in her memory since she first heard them at the age of six, were a prophesy, "You ain't got you one good mama bone in you, girl."<p></p><br><br>When Sarah reads in the local newspaper that a boy won $680 with his Grand Champion steer at the recent 1951 Fat Cattle Show &amp; Sale, she sees this as their financial salvation and finds a way to get Emerson Bridge a steer from a local farmer to compete in the 1952 show. But the young calf is unsettled at Sarah's farm, crying out in distress and growing louder as the night wears on. Some four miles away, the steer's mother hears his cries and breaks out of a barbed-wire fence to go in search of him. The next morning Sarah finds the young steer quiet, content, and nursing a large cow. Inspired by the mother cow's act of love, Sarah names her Mama Red. And so Sarah's education in motherhood begins with Mama Red as her teacher. <p></p>But Luther Dobbins, the man who sold Sarah the steer, has his sights set on winning too, and, like Sarah, he is desperate, but not for money. Dobbins is desperate for glory, wanting to regain his lost grand-champion dynasty, and he will stop at nothing to win. Emboldened by her lessons from Mama Red and her budding mama bone, Sarah is committed to victory even after she learns the winning steer's ultimate fate. Will she stop at nothing, even if it means betraying her teacher?<p></p>McClain's writing is distinguished by a sophisticated and detailed portrayal of the day-to-day realities of rural poverty and an authentic sense of time and place that marks the best southern fiction.

Schaller, Architect of Light: Watercolor Paintings by a Master</h2><p><b>Powerful Paintings from a Watercolor Master</b><br><br> "The most nearly 'perfect' paintings to me are rarely the ones simply characterized by technical expertise. More often, they are the ones in which you can sense the beating heart of the artist just below the surface--flaws included."<br><br> Twenty years into a career as architect and architectural illustrator, Thomas Schaller embarked upon a bold new path as a fine artist. Today he is one of the world's most accomplished watercolor artists, celebrated for his poignant treatment of light and its dynamic interplay with the natural and manmade landscape.<br><br> The first and only collection of work from this popular contemporary artist, <i>Thomas W. Schaller: Architect of Light</i> features 150 of his finest paintings--buildings, bridges, boats, people and other scenes from around the world. In a series of essays, Schaller ruminates on his journey as an artist, what drives him, and the "truths" he's discovered along the way. He offers not only sage insight on composition, color and other technical aspects of painting, but also provocative perspective on more fundamental struggles for the artist, such as overcoming self-doubt and honing one's own, unique voice.<br><br> Schaller's essays, like his art, shine with passion, authenticity, and the epiphanies that comprise his artistic constellation: discovering the power of breathing...the secret to "finding the art" in any subject...and how the quest for perfection led him to worry less about the final result to take greater joy in the process itself. It's a pivoting read for collector, art-lover and practicing artist alike, full of views to savor and enlighten.</p><p><b>Thomas W.

In God Bless You, Dr. Kevorkian, Vonnegut skips back and forth between life and the Afterlife as if the difference between them were rather slight. In thirty odd "interviews," Vonnegut trips down "the blue tunnel to the pearly gates" in the guise of a roving reporter for public radio, conducting interviews: with Salvatore Biagini, a retired construction worker who died of a heart attack while rescuing his schnauzer from a pit bull, with John Brown, still smoldering 140 years after his death by hanging, with William Shakespeare, who rubs Vonnegut the wrong way, and with socialist and labor leader Eugene Victor Debs, one of Vonnegut's personal heroes.<br>What began as a series of ninety-second radio interludes for WNYC, New York City's public radio station, evolved into this provocative collection of musings about who and what we live for, and how much it all matters in the end. From the original portrait by his friend Jules Feiffer that graces the cover, to a final entry from Kilgore Trout, God Bless You, Dr. Kevorkian remains a joy.</p><p>1 1-hour cassettesKURT VONNEGUT was among the few grandmasters of twentieth-century American letters, one without whom the very term American literature would mean much less than it does now.

His graphically unforgettable descriptions of social injustice, cramped slum housing, dangerous mining conditions, squalor, hunger and growing unemployment are written with unblinking honesty, fury and great humanity. It crystallized the ideas that would be found in Orwell&#39;s later works and novels, and remains a powerful portrait of poverty, injustice and class divisions in Britain. Published with an introduction by Richard Hoggart in Penguin Modern Classics. &#39;It is easy to see why the book created and still creates so sharp an impact ... exceptional immediacy, freshness and vigour, opinionated and bold ... Above all, it is a study of poverty and, behind that, of the strength of class-divisions&#39; Richard Hoggart</p><p>Although George Orwell grew up in the relative comfort of the English middle class, his socialist convictions and general sense of fairness led him to hate his country's deeply ingrained class structure. That perspective permeates this book, but the most striking elements are the quotidian details of life that Orwell observes in his first-person account of the lives of coal miners and others in the poor north of England. <i>Wigan Pier</i> is almost too realistic at times, as Orwell brings his unparalleled powers of observation to portray the wretched conditions of the working class. That Orwell may have slanted his reporting to make things look worse than they were is a question that does not lessen the book's interest.7 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Screenwriter&#39;s Workbook: Exercises and Step-by-Step Instruction for Creating a Successful Screenplay (A Dell Trade Paperback)</h2><p>Here is your very own hands-on workshop--the book that allows ou to participate in the processes that have made Syd Fields workshops invaluable to beginners and working professionals alike.</p><p>Screenplays, according to Field, are not so much written as they are built, and in this book he provides a clear explanation of what raw materials are needed to assemble the modern Hollywood movie script.In this cogently constructed workbook--one of the standards in the industry--Field elucidates the strict three-act structure of screenplays, talks about the nature of character, describes what plot points are and where they must fall, and provides exercises to help the screenwriter take an idea from the first germ of a concept, to outline, to rewritten script.Syd Field is a screenwriter, producer, teacher, international lecturer, and author of the bestselling books <b>Screenplay</b><i>, </i><b>The Screenwriter's Workbook</b><i>, </i><b>Selling a Screenplay</b><i>,</i> and <b>Four Screenplays</b><i>.</i> Published in 1982, <b>Screenplay</b> has been translated into sixteen languages, and is used in more than 250 colleges and universities across the country.

But that support stemmed less from his wild charges about communists than his more substantiated charges that "sex perverts" had infiltrated government agencies. Although now remembered as an attack on suspected disloyalty, McCarthyism introduced "moral values" into the American political arsenal. Warning of a spreading homosexual menace, McCarthy and his Republican allies learned how to win votes.<br><br>Winner of three book awards, <i>The Lavender Scare</i> masterfully<i> </i>traces the origins of contemporary sexual politics to Cold War hysteria over national security. Drawing on newly declassified documents and interviews with former government officials, historian David Johnson chronicles how the myth that homosexuals threatened national security determined government policy for decades, ruined thousands of lives, and pushed many to suicide. As Johnson shows, this myth not only outlived McCarthy but, by the 1960s, helped launch a new civil rights struggle.<i></i></p><p>The McCarthy era is generally considered the worst period of political repression in recent American history. But while the famous question, "Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?" resonated in the halls of Congress, security officials were posing another question at least as frequently, if more discreetly: "Information has come to the attention of the Civil Service Commission that you are a homosexual. What comment do you care to make?"<br><br>Historian David K. Johnson here relates the frightening, untold story of how, during the Cold War, homosexuals were considered as dangerous a threat to national security as Communists. Charges that the Roosevelt and Truman administrations were havens for homosexuals proved a potent political weapon, sparking a "Lavender Scare" more vehement and long-lasting than McCarthy's Red Scare. Relying on newly declassified documents, years of research in the records of the National Archives and the FBI, and interviews with former civil servants, Johnson recreates the vibrant gay subculture that flourished in New Deal-era Washington and takes us inside the security interrogation rooms where thousands of Americans were questioned about their sex lives. The homosexual purges ended promising careers, ruined lives, and pushed many to suicide. But, as Johnson also shows, the purges brought victims together to protest their treatment, helping launch a new civil rights struggle.<br><br><i>The Lavender Scare</i> shatters the myth that homosexuality has only recently become a national political issue, changing the way we think about both the McCarthy era and the origins of the gay rights movement. And perhaps just as importantly, this book is a cautionary tale, reminding us of how acts taken by the government in the name of "national security" during the Cold War resulted in the infringement of the civil liberties of thousands of Americans.<b>David K.

Her most recent publications are <em>Finding My Elegy: New and Selected Poems</em> and <em>The Unreal and the Real: Selected Stories</em>.</p><p><b>Chapter One</b></p><p>There was a wall. It did not look important. It was built of uncut rocks roughly mortared. An adult could look right over it, and even a child could climb, it. Where it crossed the roadway, instead of having a gate it degenerated into mere geometry, a line, an, idea of boundary. But the idea was real. It was important. For seven generations there had been nothing in the world more important than that wall. </p><p>Like all walls it was ambiguous, two-faced. What was inside it and what was outside it depended upon which side of it you were on. </p><p>Looked at from one side, the wall enclosed a barren sixty-acre field called the Port of Anarres. On the field there were a couple of large gantry cranes, a rocket pad, three warehouses, a truck garage, and a dormitory. The dormitory looked durable, grimy, and mournful; it had no gardens, no children; plainly nobody lived there or was even meant to stay there long. It was in fact a quarantine. The wall shut in not only the landing field but also the ships that came down out of space, and the men that came on the ships, and the worlds they came from, and the rest of the universe. It enclosed the universe, leaving Anarres outside, free. </p><p>Looked at from the other side, the wall enclosed Anarres: the whole planet was inside it, a great prison camp, cut off from other worlds and other men, in quarantine. </p><p>A number of people were coming along the road towards the landing field, or standing around where the road cut through the wall. </p><p>People often came out from the nearby city of Abbenay in hopes of seeing a spaceship, or simply to see the wall, After all, it was the only boundary wall on their world. Nowhere else could they see a sign that said No Trespassing. Adolescents, particularly, were drawn to it. They came up to the wall; they sat an it. There might be a gang to watch, offloading crates from track trucks at the warehouses. There might even be a freighter on the pad. Freighters came down only eight times a year, unannounced except to syndics actually working at the Port, so when the spectators were lucky enough to see one they were excited, at first. But there they sat, and there it sat, a squat black tower in a mess of movable cranes, away off across the field. And then a woman came over from one of the warehouse crews and said, "We're shutting down for today, brothers." She was wearing the Defense armband, a sight almost as rare as a spaceship. That was a bit of a thrill. But though her tone was mild, it was final. She was the foreman of this gang, and if provoked would be backed up by her syndics. And anyhow there wasn't anything to see. The aliens, the off-worlders, stayed hiding in their ship. No show.</p><p>It was a dull show for the Defense crew, too. Sometimes the foreman wished that somebody would just try to cross the wall, an alien, crewman jumping ship, or a kid from Abbenay trying to sneak in for a. closer look at the freighter. But it never happened. Nothing ever happened. When something did happen she wasn't ready for it. </p><p>The captain of the freighter <i>Mindful</i> said to her, "Isthat mob after my ship?" </p><p>The foreman looked and saw that, in fact there was a real crowd around the gate, a hundred or more people. They were standing around, just standing, the way people had stood at produce-train stations during the Famine. It gave the foreman a scare. </p><p>"No. They, ah, protest," she said in her slow and limited Iotic. "Protest the ah: you know. Passenger?" </p><p>"You mean they're after this bastard we're supposed to take? Are they going to try to stop him, or us?" </p><p>The word "bastard," untranslatable in the foreman's language, meant nothing to her except some kind of foreign term for her people, but she had never liked the sound of it, or the captain's tone, or the captain. "Can you look after you?" she asked briefly. </p><p>"Hell, yes. You just get the rest of this cargo unIoaded, quick. And get this passenger bastard on board. No mob of Oddies is about to give us any trouble." He patted the thing he wore on his belt, a metal object like a deformed penis, and looked patronizingly at the unarmed woman.</p><p>She gave the phallic object, which she knew was a weapon, a cold glance. "Ship will be loaded by fourteen hours," she said. "Keep crew on board safe. Lift off at fourteen hours forty. If you need help, leave message on tape at Ground Control." She strode off, before the captain could one-up her. Anger made her more forceful with her crew and the crowd. "Clear the road there!" she ordered as she neared the wall. "Trucks are coming through, somebody's going to get hurt. Clear aside!" </p><p>The men and women in the crowd argued with her and with one another. They kept crossing the road, and some came inside the wall. Yet they did more or less clear the way. If the foreman had no experience in bossing a mob, they had no experience in being one. Members of a community, not elements of a collectivity, they were not moved by mass feeling, there were as many emotions there as there were people. And they did not expect commands to be arbitrary, so they had no practice in disobeying them. Their inexperience saved the passenger's life. </p><p>Some of them had come there to kill a traitor. Others had come to prevent him from leaving, or to yell insults at him, or just to look at him; and all these others obstructed the sheer brief path of the assassins.</p></p><h2>How Your House Works: A Visual Guide to Understanding and Maintaining Your Home, Updated and Expanded</h2><p><b>Understand how to maintain everything in your home&#x2014;including the kitchen sink</b> <p><i>How Your House Works, Second Edition</i> reinforces the fact that it pays to be an informed consumer.

Christine Valters Paintner shares one of the most ancient paths to understanding from her study of monasticism and immersion into Celtic spirituality while living in Ireland. The Celtic way, which Paintner distills into twelve practices, offers discernment that focuses on the environment rather than the intellectual focus present in other forms of discernment. It allows for what Paintner calls the &#x201c;soul&#x2019;s slow ripening,&#x201d; coming into the fullness of our own sweetness before we pluck the fruit.</p><p>Each chapter begins with a story of a particular Irish saint&#x2014;some well-known like Patrick or Brigid, others less so, such as Ita and Ciaran&#x2014;and then introduces a helpful practice for discernment that the saint&#x2019;s life illustrates. Paintner explores the call of dreams, the importance of thresholds, the practice of <i>peregrination </i>(wandering for the love of God), walking the rounds, learning by heart, soul friends, blessing each moment, and the wisdom of the landscape and the seasons. Readers are invited to explore these concepts through photography and writing. She invites us to contemplative walks with specific themes along with poetic writing prompts for expression.</p><p>As you explore an alternate way of discerning a spiritual path&#x2014;one which honors the moment-by-moment invitations and the soul&#x2019;s seasonal rhythms&#x2014;you will discover that this book will help you become more aligned with creativity and wholeness.</p></p><p><b>Christine Valters Paintner</b> is the online abbess for Abbey of the Arts, a virtual monastery offering classes and resources on contemplative practice and creative expression.

A lonely young boy stoically cares for his grandfather while a disabled couple tries to protect their a violent relative.

We meet some of the same people--the McPheron brothers, Tom Guthrie and Maggie Jones, Victoria and her daughter Katie, and are introduced to new ones. Once again, the quirky bachelors Harold and Raymond McPheron, short on conversation and long on heart, form the sweet center of the book. The constants here are the brothers, the landscape--by turns hostile, demanding and renewing--and a few of the locals, whom we meet in varying degrees of their travails and redemption.<p> Victoria, the young pregnant woman the brothers took in in <i>Plainsong</i>, has gone off to college at Fort Collins, leaving the brothers standing at the kitchen counter, "drinking coffee and talking about how Victoria Roubideaux was doing a hundred and twenty-five miles away from home ... while they themselves were living as usual in the country in Holt County ... with so much less to account for now that she was gone, and a wind rising up and starting to whine outside the house." Much as <i>Seinfeld</i> was called the TV show about nothing, Haruf's books are so low-key and straightforward that a careless reader might miss the fact that they are about everything that life has to offer: love, sorrow, malice, understanding, and the connections that make and keep us human, to name a few.</p><p> DJ is an 11-year-old living alone with his grandfather, when he befriends two young girls whose father left for Alaska and decided not to return. Their mother is mired in grief and the three children, abandoned by the adults in their lives, find refuge in an old shed they make habitable. "So for a while the two sisters and the boy lay on the floor under the blankets, reading books in the dim candlelight, with the sun falling down outside in the alley, the three of them talking a little softly, drinking coffee from a thermos, and what was happening in the houses they&#x2019;d come from, seemed, for that short time, of little importance." One of Haruf's particular gifts is in showing us people who give and take solace wherever it may be found. </p><p> An unfortunate disabled couple, parents of two young children, are trying to make their way in a world they cannot fathom. They are assisted by Rose Tyler, their caseworker, who is a friend of Maggie Jones. aggie, who drew Tom Guthrie out of his depression in <i>Plainsong</i>, is once again a catalyst for change when she introduces Rose to Raymond.

But when Cousin Garland dares to criticize Julius, Lilly bullies her into loudly admiring Julius as the baby of the world.</p><p>"Julius is the baby of the world," said his parents. But Lilly, his older sister, disagreed. She thought he was disgusting. She hoped he would go away. But he didn't. He stayed and stayed and stayed. Nothing her parents said or did could change Lilly's mind about Julius. But when Cousin Garland had a thing or two to say about the situation, Lilly had a change of heart.</p></p><p>For children who are facing the arrival of a new sibling, <i>Julius, the Baby of the World</i> makes for great biblio-therapy. At first, big sister Lilly thought it might be fun to have a new baby in the family. But when her parents repeatedly coo, "Julius is the baby of world," Lilly's mouse hackles begin to rise. Soon the jealousy is too much for her, and she embarks on a rejection campaign that is hysterically funny, but also comforting for siblings who probably feel just as much resentment but would never go to Lilly's extremes. Kevin Henkes, creator of <i>Lilly's Purple Plastic Purse</i> refuses to shy away from the truly powerful and sometimes dark feelings of children. Through bright watercolors and handwritten, cartoon-style dialogue, Henkes relishes Lilly's wickedness. For example, she delights in insulting her oblivious baby brother: "If you were a food, you'd be a raisin," she whispers into his crib. "If you were a number you'd be zero." When she paints an elaborate family portrait, she leaves Julius out. When she throws a tea party, guess which baby doesn't get an invitation? But when a visiting cousin starts insulting baby Julius, we discover that the flip side of Lilly's intense jealousy is an even more powerful and lasting loyalty.

And that is how Marjan's story begins.... <br> It falls to Marjan to help Shahrazad find new stories -- ones the Sultan has never heard before. To do that, the girl is forced to undertake a dangerous and forbidden mission: sneak from the harem and travel the city, pulling tales from strangers and bringing them back to Shahrazad. But as she searches the city, a wonderful thing happens. From a quiet spinner of tales, Marjan suddenly becomes the center of a more surprising story than she ever could have imagined.</p><p>Susan Fletcher is the acclaimed author of&nbsp;<i>Journey of the Pale Bear</i>;&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;the Dragon Chronicles, composed of&nbsp;<i>Dragon&#x2019;s Milk</i>,&nbsp;<i>Flight of the Dragon Kyn</i>,&nbsp;<i>Sign of the Dove</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Ancient, Strange, and Lovely</i>;&nbsp;and the award-winning&nbsp;<i>Alphabet of Dreams</i>,&nbsp;<i>Shadow Spinner</i>,&nbsp;<i>Walk Across the Sea</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Falcon in the Glass</i>.

With her crippled foot, Marjan never expects to be dragged off to the palace, but that is what happens after a chance meeting with Shahrazadthe storyteller who wins her life each night with cliffhanging stories for the sultan, and who obtains a story from Marjan. Heartbroken at leaving her Aunt Chava and her Uncle Eli, Marjan confronts cruelty within the palace's lush interior, where wives and concubines can be executed at the sultan's whim, and where the Khatun, the sultan's mother, spies on everyone. Dispatched by Shahrazad to find more stories, Marjan sneaks out into the marketplace, where she eventually finds an old storyteller who tells her the end of a story of which the sultan has become fond. Beaten and imprisoned by the Khatun, Marjan escapes the palace, only to return and tell the sultan an allegory that enables him to realize his love for Shahrazad, and to spare her life. Despite the licenses Fletcher takes with the story of Shahrazad, the novel may entice readers into the pages of Richard Burton's far richer work; they will appreciate the power of storytellingthat it may expand the soul of even the most hardened listener.

Many churches are poised for action but unsure of what action to take.</p> <p> In <i>On Guard</i>, Deepak Reju examines why child predators target churches and offers eleven straightforward strategies to protect children from abuse and to help young victims recover if it does happen. While <i>On Guard</i> does provide practical help for building a child protection policy, it provides much more. Full of pastoral wisdom, <i>On Guard</i> recognizes that the church's response to abuse must be more comprehensive in line with her calling than a simple legal policy or clinical analysis. <i>On Guard</i>moves church staff and leaders beyond fearful awareness to prayerful preparedness with an actionable plan.</p> <p>Church, be on guard!

Highlighting both the responsibility and privilege of our stewardship, Deepak's straightforward, thorough, and well-researched insights will instill in any parent or church leader a healthy fear and God-dependent confidence while providing us with practical steps and effective strategies for fulfilling the calling and responsibility we have as God's stewards.

Whether your church is just starting to formulate a child protection policy or seeking to protect the children in its care more effectively, this book will be a very useful resource in addressing the challenges and, most important of all, in keeping children safe and giving comfort and care to the victims of abuse. <br> --<b>Carl R Trueman, </b>Pastor, Cornerstone Presbyterian Church, Ambler, PA; Paul Woolley Professor of Church History, Westminster Theological Seminary, Philadelphia<br><br>Deepak has given the church a fine gift.

Middle-class urban youth, migrant farm laborers, boxcar kids, children whose families found themselves struggling for survival . . . all Depression-era young people faced challenges like unemployed and demoralized parents, inadequate food and shelter, schools they couldn&#x2019;t attend because they had to go to work, schools that simply closed their doors. Even so, life had its bright spots&#x2014;like favorite games and radio shows&#x2014;and many young people remained upbeat and optimistic about the future.<br><br>Drawing on memoirs, diaries, letters, and other firsthand accounts, and richly illustrated with classic archival photographs, this book by one of the most celebrated authors of nonfiction for children places the Great Depression in context and shows young readers its human face.

Mr. Freedman lives in New York City and travels widely to research his books.</p><h2>The Power of Play: Learning What Comes Naturally</h2><p>Today's parents often worry that their children will be at a disadvantage if they are not engaged in constant learning, but child development expert David Elkind reassures us that imaginative play goes far to prepare children for academic and social success. Through expert analysis of the research and powerful examples, Elkind shows how creative, spontaneous play fosters healthy mental and social development and sets the stage for academic learning in the first place. An important contribution to the literature about how children learn, <i>The Power of Play</i> restores play's respected place in children's lives and encourages parents to trust their instincts to stay away from many of the dubious educational products on the market.</p><p><b>David Elkind</b>, Ph.D., is Professor Emeritus at Tufts University and the author of a dozen books, including <i>The Hurried Child</i> and <i>All Grown Up and No Place to Go</i>. He lives outside of Boston and on Cape Cod.<i>Starred Review.</i> In this fascinating look at the importance of letting kids be kids, Elkind argues that "Play is being silenced." According to Elkind, a child psychologist and author of <i>All Grown Up and No Place to Go</i>, important, unstructured play is too often replaced in modern times by organized activities, academics or passive leisure activities such as watching television and playing video games. Elkind explains how even toys have changed: "toys once served to socialize children into social roles, vocations, and academic tool skills. Today, they are more likely to encourage brand loyalties, fashion consciousness, and group think." Elkind acknowledges that technology has its place in the classroom, but debunks computer programs marketed toward babies and preschoolers whose young brains are not yet able to fully comprehend two-dimensional representations. "Parent peer pressure" is often to blame, causing parents to engage in "hyperparenting, overprotection, and overprogramming." Media-spread fears about everything from kidnapping and molestation to school shootings and SIDS can cause parents to forget that "children can play safely without adult organization; they have done so as long as people have been on earth." With clarity and insight, Elkind calls for society to bring back long recesses, encourage imagination and let children develop their minds at a natural pace. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

During his abbacy he built Rievaulx into a place of spiritual welcome and physical prosperity, desiring to make it a mother of mercy" to those in need. In a three-book Ciceronian dialogue Aelred defines human friendship as sacramental, beginning in creation, as God sought to place his own love of society in all his creatures, linking friends to Christ in this life and culminating in friendship with God in beatitude. This fresh new translation makes the work crisply readable, allowing the intellectual and Christian insight of this great Cistercian teacher and writer to speak clearly to today's seekers of love, wisdom, and truth.</p></p><p>Marsha L.

A series of spiritual exercises filled with wisdom, practical guidance, and profound understanding of human behavior, it remains one of the greatest works of spiritual and ethical reflection ever written. Marcus&#x2019;s insights and advice&#x2014;on everything from living in the world to coping with adversity and interacting with others&#x2014;have made the Meditations required reading for statesmen and philosophers alike, while generations of ordinary readers have responded to the straightforward intimacy of his style. For anyone who struggles to reconcile the demands of leadership with a concern for personal integrity and spiritual well-being, the <i>Meditations </i>remains as relevant now as it was two thousand years ago.<br><br>Throughout history, some books have changed the world. They have transformed the way we see ourselves&#x2014;and each other. They have inspired debate, dissent, war and revolution. They have enlightened, outraged, provoked and comforted. They have enriched lives&#x2014;and destroyed them.<br><br>Now, Penguin brings you the works of the great thinkers, pioneers, radicals and visionaries whose ideas shook civilization, and helped make us who we are. Penguin's Great Ideas series features twelve groundbreaking works by some of history's most prodigious thinkers, and each volume is beautifully packaged with a unique type-drive design that highlights the bookmaker's art. Offering great literature in great packages at great prices, this series is ideal for those readers who want to explore and savor the Great Ideas that have shaped the world.</p><p>One measure, perhaps, of a book's worth, is its intergenerational pliancy: do new readers acquire it and interpret it afresh down through the ages? The <i>Meditations</i> of Marcus Aurelius, translated and introduced by Gregory Hays, by that standard, is very worthwhile, indeed. Hays suggests that its most recent incarnation--as a self-help book--is not only valid, but may be close to the author's intent. The book, which Hays calls, fondly, a "haphazard set of notes," is indicative of the role of philosophy among the ancients in that it is "expected to provide a 'design for living.'" And it does, both aphoristically ("Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life. Now take what's left and live it properly.") and rhetorically ("What is it in ourselves that we should prize?"). Whether these, and other entries ("Enough of this wretched, whining monkey life.") sound life-changing or like entries in a teenager's diary is up to the individual reader, as it should be. Hays's introduction, which sketches the life of Marcus Aurelius (emperor of Rome A.D. 161-180) as well as the basic tenets of stoicism, is accessible and jaunty. <i>--H. O'Billovich</i>A series of spiritual exercises filled with wisdom, practical guidance, and profound understanding of human behavior, Marcus Aurelius's "Meditations remains one of the greatest works of spiritual and ethical reflection ever written.

The early attempts to define Chiron were the most rapid planetary research in the history of astrology. The reason for this quick action is simple: Chiron can be a healer or a killer. It rules initiation into the next level of awareness. <br> <br>This remarkable book has everything you need to use Chiron to enhance your astrological readings and apply that knowledge to your own life. <br>Barbara Hand Clow is an international lecturer and workshop teacher and writer.

The nine exquisite examples in this collection show her in full command of her formidable powers. In &#x201c;The Summer People,&#x201d; a young girl in rural North Carolina serves as uneasy caretaker to the mysterious, never-quite-glimpsed visitors who inhabit the cottage behind her house. In &#x201c;I Can See Right Through You,&#x201d; a middle-aged movie star makes a disturbing trip to the Florida swamp where his former on- and off-screen love interest is shooting a ghost-hunting reality show. In &#x201c;The New Boyfriend,&#x201d; a suburban slumber party takes an unusual turn, and a teenage friendship is tested, when the spoiled birthday girl opens her big present: a life-size animated doll.<br><br> Hurricanes, astronauts, evil twins, bootleggers, Ouija boards, iguanas, <i>The Wizard of Oz,</i> superheroes, the Pyramids . . . These are just some of the talismans of an imagination as capacious and as full of wonder as that of any writer today. But as fantastical as these stories can be, they are always grounded by sly humor and an innate generosity of feeling for the frailty&#x2014;and the hidden strengths&#x2014;of human beings. In <i>Get in Trouble, </i>this one-of-a-kind talent expands the boundaries of what short fiction can do.<br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Get in Trouble</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Ridiculously brilliant . . .

There is a limited but esteemed number of writers who can pull this genre off well, and Kelly Link fits in nicely among them. She has drawn comparisons to likes of Margaret Atwood, and I would even say Angela Carter. To be sure, <i>Get in Trouble</i> possesses the same sort of dark, crackling wit that is a signature of their works. But Link is in a league all her own. Standouts in this short story collection are the &#x201c;Summer People,&#x201d; where an unwitting caretaker finds herself beholden to mischievous fairies (just go with me, here), the melancholy &#x201c;Origin Story&#x201d; about a woman and her erstwhile lover (who happens to be a superhero), and the less wondrously weird but affecting &#x201c;The Lesson&#x201d; that follows a worried gay couple anticipating the birth of their first child. For all the fantastical elements, Link&#x2019;s stories dexterously explore the gamut of human emotion.

The last thing Robertson needs is a messy, racially fraught murder, even if it means overtime&#x2015;and the opportunity to clinch the promotion he craves. Then there's that nutritionally demanding (and psychologically acute) intestinal parasite in his gut. Yes, things are going badly for this utterly corrupt tribune of the law, but in an Irvine Welsh novel nothing is ever so bad that it can't get a whole lot worse. . . .In Bruce Robertson Welsh has created one of the most compellingly misanthropic characters in contemporary fiction, in a dark and disturbing and often scabrously funny novel about the abuse of everything and everybody.<br><br> "Welsh writes with a skill, wit and compassion that amounts to genius. He is the best thing that has happened to British writing in decades."&#x2015;<em>Sunday Times</em> [London]&nbsp; "[O]ne of the most significant writers in Britain. He writes with style, imagination, wit, and force, and in a voice which those alienated by much current fiction clearly want to hear."&#x2015;<em>Times Literary Supplement</em> "Welsh writes with such vile, relentless intensity that he makes Louis-Ferdinand C�line, the French master of defilement, look like Little Miss Muffet. "&#x2015;Courtney Weaver, <em>The New York Times Book Review</em> "The corrupt Edinburgh cop-antihero of Irvine Welsh's best novel since <em>Trainspotting</em> is an addictive personality in another sense: so appallingly powerful is his character that it's hard to put the book down....[T]he rapid-fire rhythm and pungent dialect of the dialogue carry the reader relentlessly toward the literally filthy denouement. "&#x2015;<em>Village Voice Literary Supplement</em>, "Our 25 Favorite Books of 1998" "Welsh excels at making his trash-spewing bluecoat peculiarly funny and vulnerable&#x2015;and you will never think of the words 'Dame Judi Dench' in the same way ever again. [Grade:] A-. "&#x2015;Charles Winecoff, <em>Entertainment Weekly</em></p><p>Talk about truth in advertising! Irvine Welsh's novel about an evil Edinburgh cop is filthy enough to please the most crud-craving fans of his blockbuster debut, <i>Trainspotting</i>. Like <i>Trainspotting</i>, <i>Filth</i> matches its nastiness with a maniacal, deeply peeved sense of humor. Though one does feel the need to escape this train wreck of a narrative from time to time for a shower and some chamomile tea, just as often Welsh provokes a belly laugh with an extraordinarily perverse and cruelly funny set piece. Nicely violent turns of phrase litter the ghastly landscape of his tale. <p> Our hero, Detective Sergeant Bruce Robertson, is a cross between Harvey Keitel in <i>Bad Lieutenant</i> and John Belushi in <i>Animal House</i>. His task is to nab a killer who has brained the son of the Ghanaian ambassador, but bigoted Bruce is more urgently concerned with coercing sex from teenage Ecstasy dealers, planning vice tours of Amsterdam, and mulling over his lurid love life. He's also got a tapeworm, whose monologue is printed right down the middle of many pages. Here's one of this unusually articulate parasite's realizations: "My problem is that I seem to have quite a simple biological structure with no mechanism for the transference of all my grand and noble thoughts into fine deeds."</p><p> Welsh's real strength is comic tough talk and inventive slang. The murder mystery helps organize his tendency to sprawl, but the engine of his art is wry, harsh dialogue. At one point, his books hogged the entire top half of Scotland's Top Ten Bestsellers list--and half the buyers of <i>Trainspotting</i> had never bought a book before. The reason is not that Welsh is the best novelist who ever got short-listed for the Booker Prize. It is that he is that rarest of phenomena, an original voice. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>With the festive season almost upon him, Detective Sergeant Bruce Robertson is winding down at work and gearing up socially -- kicking off Christmas with a week of sex and drugs in Amsterdam. There are irritating flies in the ointment, though, including a missing wife, a nagging cocaine habit, a dramatic deterioration in his genital health, a string of increasingly demanding extra-marital affairs. The last thing he needs is a messy murder to solve. Still it will mean plenty of overtime, a chance to stitch up some colleagues and finally clinch the promotion he craves. <p>But as Bruce spirals through the lower reaches of degradation and evil, he encounters opposition -- in the form of truth and ethical conscience -- from the most unexpected quarter of all: his anus. In Bruce Robertson, Welsh has created one of the most corrupt, misanthropic characters in contemporary fiction and has written a dark, disturbing and very funny novel about sleaze, power, and the abuse of everything. At last, a novel that lives up to its name.</p> <p><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p></p><h2>Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the 1920s (Harper Perennial Modern Classics)</h2><p>Prohibition. Al Capone. The President Harding scandals. The revolution of manners and morals. Black Tuesday. These are only an inkling of the events and figures characterizing the wild, tumultuous era that was the Roaring Twenties. Originally published in 1931, <i>Only Yesterday</i> traces the rise if post-World War I prosperity up to the Wall Street crash of 1929 against the colorful backdrop of flappers, speakeasies, the first radio, and the scandalous rise of skirt hemlines. Hailed as an instant classic, this is Frederick Lewis Allen's vivid and definitive account of one of the twentieth century's most fascinating decades, chronicling a time of both joy and terror--when dizzying highs were quickly succeeded by heartbreaking lows.</p><p>Originally published in 1931, soon after the era ended, this preprinted edition is still considered a classical account of the 1920s. Beginning with the end of World War I (November 11, 1918) on through to the stock market crash on November 12, 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression, the author provides a well-written history of the times. Some of the events of the day included are: Al Capone and Prohibition, scandals surrounding then president Harding, growth of the automobile industry, the first radio, and the &#34;scandalous&#34; rise of skirt hemlines.Only Yesterday Hailed as a classic even when it was first published in 1931, Only Yesterday remains one of the most vivid and precise accounts of the volatile stock market and the heady boom years of the 1920&#x2019;s. A vibrant social history that is unparalleled in scope and accuracy, it artfully depicts the rise of post&#x2014;World War I prosperity, the catalytic incidents that led to the Crash of 1929, and the devastating economic decline that ensued&#x2014;all set before a colorful backdrop of flappers, Al Capone, the first radio, and the "scandalous" rise of skirt hemlines. Now, this mesmerizing chronicle is reintroduced to offer readers of today an unforgettable look at one of the most dynamic periods of America&#x2019;s past. With a novelist&#x2019;s eye for detail and a historian&#x2019;s attention to the facts, Frederick Lewis Allen tells a story that will ignite your imagination as its rich pageant of characters and events comes alive. Peppering his narrative with actual stock quotes and financial news, Allen tracks the major economic trends of the decade and explores the underlying causes of the Crash. Here are fresh accounts of Harding&#x2019;s oil scandals and the growth of the automobile industry, as well as the decline of the family farm, the Coolidge prosperity, and the long bull market of the late twenties. Allen&#x2019;s virtual hour-by-hour account of the Crash itself, told from multiple perspectives with mounting suspense, is as gripping as anything you are likely to read in fiction. In addition to his power as a storyteller, Allen was a living witness to the events he describes; there is a thrilling you-are-there feeling about the unfolding history. After a brief "return to normalcy" following the War, the pace of life in America quickly escalated to a full gallop. New forces were being unleashed: prosperity with serious inflation, larger-than-life figures such as J. Pierpont Morgan and Henry Ford, and the Big Red Scare of the early twenties. Allen documents the new inventions, fads, and scandals as they affected the daily life of the country, including the impact of Freud and Einstein, Prohibition and Al Capone, Babe Ruth and Jack Dempsey, the trial of Sacco and Vanzetti, and the shocking changes in manners and morals. In Only Yesterday we hear America talking to itself from coast to coast, furiously debating its own rapidly evolving destiny. An engaging narrative that describes the harried, often tumultuous events of Wall street in the twenties, as well as the infectious spirit of the times, Only Yesterday is not only a compelling account of years gone by, but a true classic that will be appreciated for years to come.</p><h2>A Schoolteacher in Old Alaska: The Story of Hannah Breece</h2><p>When Hannah Breece came to Alaska in 1904, it was a remote lawless wilderness of prospectors, murderous bootleggers, tribal chiefs, and Russian priests.&nbsp;&nbsp;She spent fourteen years educating Athabascans, Aleuts, Inuits, and Russians with the stubborn generosity of a born teacher and the clarity of an original and independent mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jane Jacobs, Hannah's great-niece, here offers an historical context to Breece's remarkable eyewitness account, filling in the narrative gaps, but always allowing the original words to ring clearly.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is more than an adventure story:&nbsp;&nbsp;it is a powerful work of women's history that provides important--and, at times, unsettling--insights into the unexamined assumptions and attitudes that governed white settler's behavior toward native communities at the turn of the century.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"An unforgettable...story of a remarkable woman who lived a heroic life."--<i>The New York Times</i></p><p>Over fifty years ago Hannah Breece bestowed upon her great niece, Jane Jacobs, her manuscript, roughly culled together from diaries and letters from when she was a school teacher in Alaska and the Yukon. In the summer of 1994, Ms. Jacobs traveled to Alaska to do the research necessary to complete her great aunt's book. <br>In 1904, Hannah Breece set off for Alaska, where she was sent by the American government to teach Aleuts, Dina'ina, Athabascans, and people of mixed-European and Native blood. She remained in Alaska until 1918 and in this book tells her story. Diary-like in is mingling of domestic matters, work, public events and chance encounters, Hannah Breece's narrative is spiced with litany of adventures, for she was a women who went anywhere and stood up to anybody. <br>What Hannah Breece could never have guessed was just how relevant her story is today, both in its study of an independent woman and in its early clues to white North America's treatment of the Native populations. In her introduction and comprehensive notes on the book, Jane Jacobs examines her great aunt's story and reveals and illuminates the mysteries behind this most unusual life.Hannah Breece braved the Alaskan wilderness nearly a century ago to teach native children how to become Americans. A proud and fiercely independent woman, she struggled against great odds to establish federally sponsored schools in remote settlements. This is her own story of her many adventures on the Alaskan frontier. Breece compiled a draft of her experiences from her diaries and letters, but never completed the project. Before she died, she entrusted the manuscript to her great-niece Jane Jacobs, and this delightful book is the results. Jane Jacobs visited the communities her great-aunt described to fill in some of the gaps in her story. Her original research complements Hannah Breece&#39;s story to give us a vivid picture of old Alaska, of the infant settlements of Juneau, Kodiak, Seward and Fairbanks, and of the amazing woman who conquered its frozen wilderness, loved its children and, for nearly fifteen years, made it her home.</p><h2>The Design of Business: Why Design Thinking is the Next Competitive Advantage</h2><p>Most companies today have innovation envy. They yearn to come up with a game&#x2014;changing innovation like Apple's iPod, or create an entirely new category like Facebook.

In <i>The Design of Business</i>, Roger Martin offers a compelling and provocative answer: we rely far too exclusively on analytical thinking, which merely refines current knowledge, producing small improvements to the status quo.<br><br>To innovate and win, companies need design thinking.

In its pagese, Paramahansa Yogananda explores little-known and rarely explained aspects of such subjects as meditation, life after death, health and healing, the unlimited powers of the human mind, the equality of man and woman, and the interrelatedness of all life.<br><b>Topics include:</b> <br>* Making Religion Scientific <br>* Will Jesus Reincarnate? <br>* Three Paths to Cosmic Consciousness<br>* The Dream Nature of the World</p><p>Man&#x2019;s Eternal Quest is a book about God: about God&#x2019;s place in man&#x2019;s life; in his hopes, will, aspirations, accomplishments. Life, man, achievement&#x2014;all are but manifestations of the one omnipresent Creator, as inseparably dependent on Him as the wave is dependent on the ocean. Paramahansa Yogananda explains why and how man was created by God, and how he is immutably a part of God, and what this means to each one personally. Realization of the oneness of man and his Creator is the whole essence of Yoga. An understanding of man&#x2019;s inescapable need for God, in every aspect of living, removes the otherworldliness from religion and makes knowing God the basis of a scientific and practical approach to life.Hailed as "the father of Yoga in the West", Paramahansa Yogananda - author of the spiritual classic <i>Autobiography of a Yogi</i> - is regarded as one of the great spiritual figures of our time. Born in northern India on January 5, 1893, he devoted his life to helping people of all races and creeds to realize and express more fully in their lives the true beauty, nobility, and divinity of the human spirit. After graduating from Calcutta University in 1915, Yogananda took formal vows as a monk of India's venerable monastic Swami Order. Two years later, he began his life's work with the founding of a how-to-live school since grown to twenty-one educational institutions throughout India where traditional academic subjects were offered together with yoga training and instruction in spiritual ideals. In 1920, he was invited to serve as India's delegate to an International Congress of Religious Liberals in Boston. His address to the Congress and subsequent lectures on the East Coast were enthusiastically received, and in 1924 he embarked on a cross-continental speaking tour. Over the next three decades, Paramahansa Yogananda contributed in far-reaching ways to a greater awareness and appreciation in the West of the spiritual wisdom of the East. In Los Angeles, he established an international headquarters for <b>Self-Realization Fellowship,</b> the nonsectarian religious society he had founded in 1920. Through his writings, extensive lecture tours, and the creation of Self-Realization Fellowship temples and meditation centers, he introduced hundreds of thousands of truth-seekers to the ancient science and philosophy of Yoga and its universally applicable methods of meditation. Today, the spiritual and humanitarian work begun by Paramahansa Yogananda continues under the direction of Sri Mrinalini Mata, one of his closest disciples and president of Self-Realization Fellowship/Yogoda Satsanga Society of India since 2011. In addition to publishing his writings, lectures and informal talks (including a comprehensive series of Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons for home study), the society also oversees temples, retreats, and centers around the world.</p><h2>Thinking in Time: The Uses of History for Decision-Makers</h2><p>&#x201c;A convincing case that careful analysis of the history, issues, individuals, and institutions can lead to better decisions&#x2014;in business as well as in government&#x201d; (<i>BusinessWeek</i>).<br><br>Two noted professors offer easily remembered rules for using history effectively in day-to-day management of governmental and corporate affairs to avoid costly blunders. &#x201c;An illuminating guide to the use and abuse of history in affairs of state&#x201d; (Arthur Schlesinger).</p><p>Richard E.

Building on its companion volumes, the <em>New Bible Dictionary</em> and <em>New Bible Commentary,</em> this work takes readers to a higher vantage point where they can view the thematic terrain of the Bible in its canonical wholeness. In addition, it fills the interpretive space between those volumes and the <em>New Dictionary of Theology.</em> At the heart of this work is an A-to-Z encyclopedia of over 200 key biblical-theological themes such as atonement, creation, eschatology, Israel, Jesus Christ, the kingdom of God, redemption, suffering, wisdom and worship. Students and communicators of the Bible will be well served by articles exploring the theology of each biblical book. And for those interested in the wider discipline of biblical theology, major articles explore foundational issues such as the history of biblical theology, the challenges raised against biblical theology, and the unity and diversity of Scripture. Over 120 contributors drawn from the front ranks of biblical scholarship in the English-speaking world make the <em>New Dictionary of Biblical Theology</em> a work of distinction and a benchmark of evangelical biblical theology at the turn of the twenty-first century. Bibliographies round out all articles, directing readers to research trails leading out of the <em>Dictionary</em> and into crucial studies on every subject. Cross-references throughout send readers through the varied maze of reading pathways, maximizing the usefulness of this volume. Comprehensive, authoritative and easily accessible, the <em>New Dictionary of Biblical Theology</em> is certain to establish itself as an essential resource for students of the Bible and theology.</p><p>"The advent of the <em>New Dictionary of Biblical Theology</em> is both timely and highly significant. It is timely because of the increasing recognition in both scholarly and popular Christian circles of the need to integrate biblical themes, ideas and passages into the message of the Bible as a whole (whatever diversity there may be within it). The volume is important because of the quality and scope of its articles, which are helpfully divided into three sections: those dealing with fundamental issues relating to biblical theology, articles about various books and corpora of the Scriptures, and those on key biblical topics. This dictionary will be an invaluable aid to all students and teachers of the Bible who want to understand the relation of the parts to the whole thrust of the Scriptures." (Peter O'Brien, Moore Theological College, Sydney, Australia)<br><br>"At least once in each generation, change of such magnitude takes place in a field of study that standard reference books have to be revised and new ones written. What Kevin Vanhoozer has called in this volume the 'second coming' of biblical theology in the twentieth century is just such a change. It has stimulated fresh interest in the theological unity of the Bible and renewed study of themes across the whole sweep of biblical revelation. The <em>New Dictionary of Biblical Theology</em> is keenly attuned to this welcome development and draws on the best of contemporary evangelical scholarship. It is a quality volume, which I'm sure will become a standard reference work for all serious Bible students, especially those committed to teaching and preaching the whole Bible as Christian Scripture." (Barry G. Webb, Moore Theological College, Sydney, Australia)<br><br>"The idea that the writings of the Old and New Testaments form a coherent whole is at odds with current scholarly fashion. The Christian 'Old Testament' has become a supposedly more neutral 'Hebrew Bible,' only loosely related to the New Testament; and the emphasis on the distinctiveness of the individual biblical texts has led to a systematic neglect of their deep interrelatedness. This fragmentation of the Bible undermines its single though diverse testimony to the action of the triune God in and for the world. Evangelical scholarship has always been concerned with the whole Bible and is uniquely well placed to resist this trend toward fragmentation. The <em>New Dictionary of Biblical Theology</em> is a timely challenge to contemporary scholarship to reconsider its prejudice against coherence. It is a welcome sign that biblical theology continues to flourish and that reports of its demise have been greatly exaggerated." (Francis Watson, Durham University, England)<br><br>"<em>The New Dictionary of Biblical Theology</em> is a valuable resource for teachers, preachers and students. There are excellent surveys of key issues such as 'The Unity and Diversity of Scripture' and 'Relationship of Old Testament and New Testament,' plus more detailed articles on biblical books, themes, characters, etc. Most of those I have read reflect thorough research and breadth of knowledge. Helpful bibliographies are provided after each article. . . . The emphasis on the theological significance of the topics covered is a distinctive contribution of this work." (David L.

My hair is blond with some chemical assistance. My eyes are brown from my Grandpa Harry. I&#x2019;m 5'5" tall, and my breasts measure more than my waist so I&#x2019;m a happy camper. I had a mildly embarrassing childhood free from any truly significant disasters. I �wasn&#x2019;t a cheerleader or the prom queen. I �didn&#x2019;t graduate with honors. I chose culinary school after high school, where I limped my way through butchering beasts and excelled at baking cakes. I was engaged and disengaged. Good riddance to him. In January, three days after my �twenty-�eighth birthday, I inherited a house from my Great Aunt Ophelia, and I took a job as pastry chef at Dazzle&#x2019;s Bakery in Salem.<br><br>For five terrific months, I felt like my life was finally coming together. And then two men and a monkey dropped into my world and changed it forever.<br><br>One of the men is called Wulf, short for Gerwulf Gri�moire. He&#x2019;s eerily handsome, with midnight black, �shoulder-length hair that waves over his ears. His skin is pale, his eyes are dark, and his intentions are even darker. The other guy is big and scruffy, and beach bum blond. He has a hard muscled body, a questionable attitude, and a monkey named Carl. The big, scruffy guy is unexplainably charming, and he has only one name . . . Diesel.<br><br>The men are my age. And according to Diesel, we&#x2019;re part of a loosely organized band of humans with abilities beyond the ordinary. I don&#x2019;t entirely believe all this, but I don&#x2019;t disbelieve it, either. I recognize that some people are smarter, braver, stronger, can sing better, are luckier than others. So who&#x2019;s to say some people don&#x2019;t have abilities just north of normal. I mean, it&#x2019;s not like he&#x2019;s telling me he&#x2019;s Superman from the planet Krypton, right?<br><br>This is my first October in New �En�gland. I still love my job and Ophelia&#x2019;s small, �two-�bedroom saltbox that sits on the crest of a hill overlooking Marblehead Harbor. The house was built in 1740 and over the years has had some renovation, with varying degrees of success. It&#x2019;s a little lopsided and the windows �aren&#x2019;t plumb, but it has a working fireplace, and from day one it&#x2019;s felt like home.<br><br>Usually, I work from five in the morning until one in the afternoon, but today I had the day off. Rain was slanting against my kitchen windows, and the ancient maple in my backyard rattled in the wind. I was in the middle of chopping vegetables for soup when my back door blew open and Diesel stepped into my tiny mudroom. He was wearing motorcycle boots, �washed-�out jeans, a T-shirt that advertised beer, and an unzipped gray sweatshirt. He had a �two-�day beard, his hair was thick and unruly and wet from the rain, and he was sex walking.<br><br>&#x201c;I need you to come with me,&#x201d; Diesel said. &#x201c;Some guy just got pitched off his �fourth-�floor balcony, and Wulf is involved. There&#x2019;s a rumor going around that �Wulf&#x2019;s got a lead on another SALIGIA Stone. I imagine this murder fits in somehow.&#x201d;<br><br>The story Diesel tells is that seven ancient stones hold the power of the seven deadly sins. They&#x2019;re called the Stones of SALIGIA, and if you combine them in the same vessel you get �really bad juju going . . . like hell on earth. Some people believe the stones have found their way to Salem. Wulf happens to be one of those people, and he&#x2019;s made it known that he wants them. Since Wulf is thought to inhabit the dark side from time to time, Diesel has been bestowed the responsibility of preventing him from collecting the stones.<br><br>&#x201c;Ordinarily, I �wouldn&#x2019;t mind tagging along,&#x201d; I said to Diesel, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;m making soup.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, let&#x2019;s take a look at what we&#x2019;ve got. You can stay here and make soup, or you can go with me and save mankind from getting chucked into Satan&#x2019;s stew pot.&#x201d;<br><br>I blew out a sigh. Having special abilities sounds good on paper. And there are some people, like Wulf, who might enjoy the power those abilities bring, but I found the gift to be an awkward burden. I get that someone has to save mankind from the big stew pot in hell, but why me?<br><br>&#x201c;To tell you the truth, I&#x2019;ve never �really bought into the whole SALIGIA thing,&#x201d; I said to Diesel. &#x201c;And I truly don&#x2019;t feel equipped to save mankind.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You have a critical ability I lack,&#x201d; Diesel said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re one of only two people who can sense objects related to the SALIGIA Stones.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And you think I&#x2019;ll have to use that ability at this crime scene?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Probably not,&#x201d; Diesel said, &#x201c;but you&#x2019;re cute. And if I have to go look at some idiot who �face-�planted onto the sidewalk in the rain, I&#x2019;m taking you with me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You think I&#x2019;m cute?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah. Can you hurry it up here, please?&#x201d;<br><br>It&#x2019;s sort of alarming that I can be so easily swayed by a compliment, but there you have it. I scooped the chopped vegetables into my soup pot and clapped a lid on it. I grabbed my purse off the kitchen counter, snatched a hooded sweatshirt off a peg next to the door, and stepped outside.<br><br>The cloud cover was low, the rain was turning to a drizzle, and there was a chill in the air. There were still boats on moorings in the harbor below my house, but their number was significantly decreased from the summer crush. It was definitely fall in New �En�gland.<br><br>Diesel opened the white picket fence gate that led from my small backyard to the alley where he was �illegally parked. He was �driv�ing a red Jeep Grand Chero�kee that �wasn&#x2019;t new and �wasn&#x2019;t old. Usually, it was �mud-�splattered and coated in road dust. Today, the rain had washed the top layer of dirt away and it looked almost clean.<br><br>I slid onto the �passenger-�side seat, buckled myself in, and realized Carl was in the back. Carl looked up at me, gave me a finger wave, and smiled a horrible monkey smile. All monkey gums and monkey teeth and crazy bright monkey eyes.<br><br>I grew up in suburbia. We had cats, dogs, hamsters, guinea pigs, parakeets, and fish. Never a monkey. A monkey was a new, sometimes disturbing experience.<br><br>Diesel drove down Weatherby Street to Pleasant, Pleasant turned into Lafayette, and Lafayette took us to the bridge that crossed into Salem. We followed traffic through the center of town, cut off to the north side, parked behind a police cruiser on Braintree Street, and made our way over to where a small crowd was gathering.<br><br>This was a mixed neighborhood of commercial and residential. Cop cars, a truck belonging to the medical examiner, and an EMT truck were angle parked in front of a �seven-�story, yellow brick condo building that looked like it had been built in the seventies. Crime scene tape cordoned off an area in front of the building, and a makeshift screen had been erected, preventing gawkers like me from seeing the body sprawled on the �rain-�slicked pavement. Thank heaven for the screen. I �didn&#x2019;t want to see the dead guy.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know his name?&#x201d; I asked Diesel.<br><br>&#x201c;Gilbert Reedy. He&#x2019;s a professor at Harvard. My source tells me Reedy came flying through the air and crash landed with a handprint burned into his neck.&#x201d;<br><br>I felt my breakfast roll in my stomach, and my upper lip broke out in a sweat. &#x201c;Oh boy,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Damn.&#x201d;<br><br>Diesel looked down at me. &#x201c;Breathe. And think about something else.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How can I think about something else? There&#x2019;s a dead man on the ground, and he has a handprint burned into his flesh.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Think about baseball,&#x201d; Diesel said.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, baseball. Am I playing or watching?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re watching.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Am I at the park? Or is it on television?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Television.&#x201d;</p><h2>Shattered Bonds: The Color Of Child Welfare</h2><p>Shattered Bonds is a stirring account of a worsening American social crisis--the disproportionate representation of black children in the U.S. foster care system and its effects on black communities and the country as a whole. Tying the origins and impact of this disparity to racial injustice, Dorothy Roberts contends that child-welfare policy reflects a political choice to address startling rates of black child poverty by punishing parents instead of tackling poverty&#39;s societal roots. Using conversations with mothers battling the Chicago child-welfare system for custody of their children, along with national data, Roberts levels a powerful indictment of racial disparities in foster care and tells a moving story of the women and children who earn our respect in their fight to keep their families intact.</p><p>The story of foster care in this country is the story of the failure of the social safety net to aid poor, largely black, parents in their attempt to provide for their children. <i>Shattered Bonds</i> tell this story as no other book has before--from the perspective of a prominent, black, female legal theoretician.<p> The current state of the child welfare system in America is by now a well-known tragedy. Thousands of children every year are removed from their parents' homes, often for little reason other than the endemic poverty that afflicts women and children more than any other group in the U.S. Dorothy Roberts, a professor of law at Northwestern University and a widely acclaimed legal scholar and social critic, reveals the frightening racial politics of child welfare in America through extensive legal research and original interviews with Chicago families in the foster care system. <i>Shattered Bonds</i> is the first book written by a legal scholar to fully explain the foster care crisis from both the parents' and children's perspectives.</p><p> With chilling precision, <i>Shattered Bonds</i> describes the racial imbalance in foster care; the concentration of state intervention in certain neighborhoods, including the alarming percentages of children in substitute care; the difficulty that poor and black families have in meeting state's standards for regaining custody of children placed in foster care; and the relationship between state supervision of families and continuing racial inequality.</p><b>Dorothy Roberts</b> is a professor at Northwestern University School of Law and a fellow at the university's Institute for Policy Research.

Harry was a veterinarian. But he was also a soldier in training for World War I. </p><p>Harry named the bear Winnie, short for Winnipeg, his company's home town, and he brought her along to the training camp in England. Winnie followed Harry everywhere and slept under his cot every night. Before long, she became the regiment's much-loved mascot.</p><p>But who could care for the bear when Harry had to go to the battleground in France? Harry found just the right place for Winnie while he was away -- the London Zoo. There a little boy named Christopher Robin came along and played with Winnie -- he could care for this bear too!</p><p>Sally Walker's heartwarming story, paired with Jonathan Voss's evocative illustrations, brings to life the story of the real bear who inspired Winnie the Pooh.</p></p><p><p><b>Sally M. Walker</b> is the author of the ALA Notable <i>Blizzard of Glass: The Halifax Explosion of 1917</i>. She is also the author of<i> Written in Bone</i>,<i> Fossil Fish Found Alive</i>, and <i>Secrets of a Civil War Submarine</i>, which was awarded a Sibert Medal. She lives in Illinois. </p><p><b>Jonathan D. Voss </b>was a portrait artist and graphic designer before becoming a children's book illustrator. He lives in North Carolina with his family. Winnie is his first book.</p>Gr 1&#x2013;2&#x2014;Readers will be captivated by this picture book account of the bear who inspired the "Winnie-the-Pooh" series. Walker tells the story of Harry Colebourn, a World War I soldier who came upon a man selling a baby bear at a train station (he had shot the cub's mother) and decided to adopt the animal. A veterinarian, Colebourn quickly became attached to the little bear he named Winnie (short for Winnipeg, Manitoba, Colebourn's company's hometown), who accompanied the soldier to a training camp in Quebec and became a favorite of the entire regiment. Winnie even went with the company to England when more soldiers were needed across the Atlantic. When Colebourn was sent into battle, he took Winnie to the London Zoo, where she was so gentle and tame that zookeepers sometimes let children ride on her back. There, Milne's young son, Christopher Robin, met her and fell in love, motivating Milne to pen the "Winnie-the-Pooh" books. Sweet, realistic illustrations, rendered in watercolor with pen and ink, lend the work an old-fashioned air, while a simple but gentle narrative provides readers with a sense of the emotional connection between Winnie and Colebourn. Back matter offers brief material on Colebourn, Winnie, black bears in general, and Milne's writings, as well as photographs of Winnie and Christopher Robin. Children will enjoy this interesting insight into the real story behind a beloved bear they already know so well.&#x2014;April Sanders, Spring Hill College, Mobile, AL</p><h2>Sand and Steel: The D-Day Invasion and the Liberation of France</h2><p>Peter Caddick-Adams's account of the Allied invasion of France in June 1944 matches the monumental achievement of his book on the Battle of the Bulge, <em>Snow and Steel</em>, which Richard Overy has called the "standard history of this climactic confrontation in the West." <em>Sand and Steel</em> gives us D-Day, arguably the greatest and most consequential military operation of modern times, beginning with the years of painstaking and costly preparation, through to the pitched battles fought along France's northern coast, from Omaha Beach to the Falaise and the push east to Strasbourg.<br><br>In addition to covering the build-up to the invasion, including the elaborate and lavish campaigns to deceive Germans as to where and when the invasion would take place, Caddick-Adams gives a full and detailed account of the German preparations: the formidable Atlantikwall and Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's plans to make Europe impregnable-plans not completed by June 6. <em>Sand and Steel</em> reveals precisely what lay in wait for the Allies. But the heart of the book is Caddick-Adams' narratives of the five beaches where the terrible drama played out--<em>Utah</em>, <em>Omaha</em>, <em>Gold</em>, <em>Juno</em>, and <em>Sword</em>, and the attempt by American, British, and Canadian soldiers to gain a foothold in Europe. <br><br>The Allied invasion of Europe involved mind-boggling logistics, including orchestrating the largest flotilla of ships ever assembled. Its strategic and psychological demands stretched the Allies to their limits, testing the strengths of the bonds of Anglo-American leadership. Drawing on first-hand battlefield research, personal testimony and interviews, and a commanding grasp of all the archives and literature, Caddick-Adams's gripping book, published on the 75th anniversary of the events, does Operations Overlord and Neptune full justice.<br></p><p><br><strong>Peter Caddick-Adams </strong>is a lecturer in military history and current defense issues at the Defence Academy of the United Kingdom. He is the author of <em>Monte Cassino: Ten Armies in Hell</em> and <em>Snow and Steel: The Battle of the Bulge, 1944-45</em>. He holds the rank of major in the British Territorial Army and has served with U.S. forces in Bosnia, Iraq, and Afghanistan.<br><br>"It's rare for a book about as huge a subject as the Normandy invasion to be totally comprehensive, but Sand &amp; Steel genuinely is. The product of Peter Caddick-Adams' lifetime's fascination with and investigation into D-Day, its precursors and its aftermath, nothing else will need to be written on Operation Overlord for decades. Whether you are a visitor to the Normandy battlefields, a general reader interested in the greatest amphibious assault in the history of warfare, or just someone who appreciates extremely well-written military history and wants to know what it was like to have experienced combat in one of Mankind's most decisive struggles, this truly extraordinary book is undoubtedly the one for you." -- Andrew Roberts, author of <em>Churchill: Walking with Destiny</em><p></p><br>"Peter Caddick-Adams is one of our brightest military historians and SAND AND STEEL offers the whole enchilada: deep research, operational acumen, and taut, terse writing. He gives us every beach, every army, every minute, with a humane eye, and with none of the special pleading for this nation or that general that tends to mar such volumes. Caddick-Adams was there thirty-five years ago when President Ronald Reagan immortalized "the boys of Pointe du Hoc" and all the others, vowing that we would always remember them. This book helps fulfill that pledge." -- Rob Citino, Senior Historian, the National World War Two Museum, New Orleans, author of <em>Blitzkrieg to Desert Storm</em> and <em>The German Way of War</em> <br><p></p><br>"Even those who know a great deal about the Allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944 will find much to admire in this detailed account. Peter Caddick-Adams punctures a number of D-Day myths, but he is at his best in weaving together the personal stories from hundreds of interviews compiled over two decades, and the result is an account of the campaign viewed not only from the conference room or headquarters, but also from the deckplate, the cockpit, the turret, and the foxhole of ordinary soldiers, sailors and airmen." -- Craig L. Symonds, author of <em>Operation Neptune</em> and <em>World War II at Sea</em> <br><p></p><br>"A brilliant exploration of the military aspects of Overlord, this is an account of fortitude and an investigation of success. Following his excellent study of the Battle of the Bulge, Caddick-Adams does it again by explaining, as opposed to simply describing, the Allies' victory." -- Jeremy Black, author of <em>Rethinking World War Two</em> <br><p></p><br>"Sand and Steel envelops the reader like a thrilling movie- shifting, with cinematic suspense, to either side of the looming Second Front in Normandy. Caddick-Adams is as good on the Germans as the Allies, and neatly describes technology, tactics, the intelligence game, and the leading personalities. We watch the opposing armies form and train - in the fields of England and France- and shudder at their impact on D-Day, with the Allies fighting for every inch of beach and the Germans bitterly resisting." -- Geoffrey Wawro, author of <em>Sons of Freedom, A Mad Catastrophe</em>, and <em>The</em> <em>Franco-Prussian War.</em> <br><p></p><br>"A thorough, exciting, and altogether excellent choice for World War II--and especially D-Day--aficionados."--<em>Kirkus</em>, Starred Review <br><p></p><br>"This really extraordinary volume stands to become the new benchmark narrative, conveying both the scale and individual experiences of that momentous operation in a sharp and highly readable book... Caddick-Adams brings not only a historian's skill of research and narrative, he also incorporates his experiences as a military officer and battlefield explorer to add vignettes on the veterans he's personally met and interviewed, and a sort of battlefield archeology of the surviving monuments, bunkers, and other landmarks that still exist... There will no doubt be many new books to commemorate the 75th Anniversary of D-Day.

They came from every corner of Eastern Europe and the Middle East, from Egypt, Syria, Armenia, Anatolia, the Greek peninsula, but most of all from Russia, travelling by sea to the port of Jaffa where they hired camels or donkeys. By Good Friday, on 10 April 1846, there were 20,000 pilgrims in Jerusalem. They rented any dwelling they could find or slept in family groups beneath the stars. To pay for their long journey nearly all of them had brought some merchandise, a handmade crucifix or ornament, strings of beads or pieces of embroidery, which they sold to European tourists at the holy shrines. The square before the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the focus of their pilgrimage, was a busy marketplace, with colourful displays of fruit and vegetables competing for space with pilgrims' wares and the smelly hides of goats and oxen left out in the sun by the tanneries behind the church. Beggars, too, collected here. They frightened strangers into giving alms by threatening to touch them with their leprous hands. Wealthy tourists had to be protected by their Turkish guides, who hit the beggars with heavy sticks to clear a path to the church doors.In 1846 Easter fell on the same date in the Latin and Greek Orthodox calendars, so the holy shrines were much more crowded than usual, and the mood was very tense. The two religious communities had long been arguing about who should have first right to carry out their Good Friday rituals on the altar of Calvary inside the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the spot where the cross of Jesus was supposed to have been inserted in the rock. During recent years the rivalry between the Latins and the Greeks had reached such fever pitch that Mehmet Pasha, the Ottoman governor of Jerusalem, had been forced toposition soldiers inside and outside the church to preserve order. But even this had not prevented fights from breaking out.On this Good Friday the Latin priests arrived with their white linen altar-cloth to find that the Greeks had got there first with their silk embroidered cloth. The Catholics demanded to see the Greeks' firman, their decree from the Sultan in Constantinople, empowering them to place their silk cloth on the altar first. The Greeks demanded to see the Latins' firman allowing them to remove it. A fight broke out between the priests, who were quickly joined by monks and pilgrims on either side. Soon the whole church was a battlefield. The rival groups of worshippers fought not only with their fists, but with crucifixes, candlesticks, chalices, lamps and incense-burners, and even bits of wood which they tore from the sacred shrines. The fighting continued with knives and pistols smuggled into the Holy Sepulchre by worshippers of either side. By the time the church was cleared by Mehmet Pasha's guards, more than forty people lay dead on the floor.1'See here what is done in the name of religion!' wrote the English social commentator Harriet Martineau, who travelled to the Holy Lands of Palestine and Syria in 1846.This Jerusalem is the most sacred place in the world, except Mekkeh, to the Mohammedan: and to the Christian and the Jew, it is the most sacred place in the world. What are they doing in this sanctuary of their common Father, as they all declare it to be? Here are the Mohammedans eager to kill any Jew or Christian who may enter the Mosque of Omar. There are the Greeks and Latin Christians hating each other, and ready to kill any Jew or Mohammedan who may enter the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. And here are the Jews, pleading against their enemies, in the vengeful language of their ancient prophets.2The rivalry between the Christian Churches was intensified by the rapid growth in the number of pilgrims to Palestine in the nineteenth century. Railways and steamships made mass travel possible, opening up the region to tour-groups of Catholics from France and Italy and to the devout middle classes of Europe and America. The various Churches vied with one another for influence. They set up missions to support their pilgrims, competed over purchases of land, endowed bishoprics and monasteries, and established schools to convert the Orthodox Arabs(mainly Syrian and Lebanese), the largest but least educated Christian community in the Holy Lands.'Within the last two years considerable presents have been sent to Jerusalem to decorate the Church of the Holy Sepulchre by the Russian, French, Neapolitan and Sardinian governments,' reported William Young, the British consul in Palestine and Syria, to Lord Palmerston at the Foreign Office in 1839.There are many symptoms of increasing jealousy and inimical feeling among the churches. The petty quarrels that have always existed between the Latin, Greek and Armenian convents were of little moment so long as their differences were settled from time to time by the one giving a larger bribe to the Turkish authorities than the other. But that day passes by, for these countries are now no longer closed against European intrigue in church matters.3Between 1842 and 1847 there was a flurry of activity in Jerusalem: the Anglicans founded a bishopric; the Austrians set up a Franciscan printing press; the French established a consulate in Jerusalem and pumped money into schools and churches for the Catholics; Pope Pius IX re-established a resident Latin patriarch, the first since the Crusades of the twelfth century; the Greek patriarch returned from Constantinople to tighten his hold on the Orthodox; and the Russians sent an ecclesiastical mission, which led to the foundation of a Russian compound with a hostel, hospital, chapel, school and marketplace to support the large and growing number of Russian pilgrims.In the early decades of the nineteenth century, the Russian Orthodox Church sent more pilgrims to Jerusalem than any other branch of the Christian faith. Every year up to 15,000 Russian pilgrims would arrive in Jerusalem for the Easter festival, some even making the long trek on foot across Russia and the Caucasus, through Anatolia and Syria. For the Russians, the holy shrines of Palestine were objects of intense and passionate devotion: to make a pilgrimage to them was the highest possible expression of their faith.In some ways the Russians saw the Holy Lands as an extension of their spiritual motherland. The idea of 'Holy Russia' was not contained by any territorial boundaries; it was an empire of the Orthodox with sacred shrines throughout the lands of Eastern Christianity andwith the Holy Sepulchre as its mother church. 'Palestine', wrote one Russian theologian in the 1840s, 'is our native land, in which we do not recognize ourselves as foreigners.'4 Centuries of pilgrimage had laid the basis of this claim, establishing a link between the Russian Church and the Holy Places (connected with the life of Christ in Bethlehem, Jerusalem and Nazareth) which many Russians counted more important - the basis of a higher spiritual authority - than the temporal and political sovereignty of the Ottomans in Palestine.Nothing like this ardour could be found among the Catholics or Protestants, for whom the Holy Places were objects of historical interest and romantic sentiment rather than religious devotion. The travel writer and historian Alexander Kinglake thought that 'the closest likeness of a pilgrim which the Latin Church could supply was often a mere French tourist with a journal and a theory and a plan of writing a book'. European tourists were repelled by the intense passion of the Orthodox pilgrims, whose strange rituals struck them as 'barbaric' and as 'degrading superstitions'. Martineau refused to go to the Holy Sepulchre to see the washing of the pilgrims' feet on Good Friday. 'I could not go to witness mummeries done in the name of Christianity,' she wrote, 'compared with which the lowest fetishism on the banks of an African river would have been inoffensive.' For the same reason, she would not go to the ceremony of the Holy Fire on Easter Saturday, when thousands of Orthodox worshippers squeezed into the Holy Sepulchre to light their torches from the miraculous flames that appeared from the tomb of Christ. Rival groups of Orthodox - Greeks, Bulgarians, Moldavians, Serbians and Russians - would jostle with each other to light their candles first; fights would start; and sometimes worshippers were crushed to death or suffocated in the smoke. Baron Curzon, who witnessed one such scene in 1834, described the ceremony as a 'scene of disorder and profanation' in which the pilgrims, 'almost in a state of nudity, danced about with frantic gestures, yelling and screaming as if they were possessed'.5It is hardly surprising that a Unitarian such as Martineau or an Anglican like Curzon should have been so hostile to such rituals: demonstrations of religious emotion had long been effaced from the Protestant Church. Like many tourists in the Holy Land, they sensed that they had less in common with the Orthodox pilgrims, whose wildbehaviour seemed barely Christian at all, than with the relatively secular Muslims, whose strict reserve and dignity were more in sympathy with their own private forms of quiet prayer. Attitudes like theirs were to influence the formation of Western policies towards Russia in the diplomatic disputes about the Holy Land which would eventually lead to the Crimean War.Unaware of and indifferent to the importance of the Holy Lands to Russia's spiritual identity, European commentators saw only a growing Russian menace to the interests of the Western Churches there. In the early 1840s, Young, now the British consul, sent regular reports to the Foreign Office about the steady build-up of 'Russian agents' in Jerusalem - their aim being, in his view, to prepare a 'Russian conquest of the Holy Lands' through sponsored pilgrimage and purchases of land for Orthodox churches and monasteries. This was certainly a time when the Russi...</p><h2>Killings At Badgers Drift Midsomer 1</h2><p>Killings at Badgers Drift</p><p>Caroline Graham, the creator of Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby, was born in Warwickshire and educated at Nuneaton High School for Girls, and later the Open University.

Intended for young readers but enjoyed equally by adults, the fantastic tale transformed children's literature, liberating it from didactic constraints.<br>The story is deeply but gently satiric, enlivened with an imaginative plot and brilliant use of nonsense. As Alice explores a bizarre underground world, she encounters a cast of strange characters and fanciful beasts: the White Rabbit, March Hare, and Mad Hatter; the sleepy Dormouse and grinning Cheshire Cat; the Mock Turtle, the dreadful Queen of Hearts, and a host of other extraordinary personalities. This edition features Sir John Tenniel's complete original illustrations, bringing to life a beloved classic that has delighted readers and listeners since its first publication in 1865.<br></p><p>Source of legend and lyric, reference and conjecture, <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> is for most children pure pleasure in prose. While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing "The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new." There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters--extinct, fantastical, and commonplace creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they turn out to be "curiouser and curiouser," seemingly without moral or sense.<p> For more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully <i>non</i>-moralistic, <i>non</i>-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the "regular course" in school: Reeling, Writhing, and branches of Arithmetic-Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are inextricably tied to the well-loved story.

Dick&#x2019;s VALIS trilogy, <i>The Transmigration of Timothy Archer</i> brings the author&#x2019;s search for the identity and nature of God to a close. The novel follows Bishop Timothy Archer as he travels to Israel, ostensibly to examine ancient scrolls bearing the words of Christ. But, more importantly, this leads him to examine the decisions he made during his life and how they may have contributed to the suicide of his mistress and son.<br>&nbsp;This introspective book is one of Dick&#x2019;s most philosophical and literary, delving into the mysteries of religion and of faith itself. As one of Dick&#x2019;s final works, it also provides unique insight into the mind of a genius, whose work was still in the process of maturing at the time of his death.<br></p><p>ansmigration of Timothy Archer, the final novel in the trilogy that also includes <i>Valis</i> and <i>The Divine Invasion</i>, is an anguished, learned, and very moving investigation of the paradoxes of belief. It is the story of Timothy Archer, an urbane Episcopal bishop haunted by the suicides of his son and mistress--and driven by them into a bizarre quest for the identity of Christ.<p>Over a writing career that spanned three decades, PHILIP K. DICK (1928&#x2013;1982) published 36 science fiction novels and 121 short stories in which he explored the essence of what makes man human and the dangers of centralized power. Toward the end of his life, his work turned toward deeply personal, metaphysical questions concerning the nature of God. Eleven novels and short stories have been adapted to film,&nbsp;notably&nbsp;<i>Blade Runner</i> (based on <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i>), <i>Total Recall,</i><i>Minority Report,</i> and <i>A Scanner Darkly. </i>The recipient of critical acclaim and numerous awards throughout his career, Dick was inducted into the&nbsp;Science Fiction&nbsp;Hall of Fame in 2005, and in 2007 the Library of America published a selection of his novels in three volumes.

Before her passing, her fame as an author, actress, and pop-culture icon was indisputable, but in 1977,&nbsp;Carrie Fisher was just a teenager with an all-consuming crush on her costar, Harrison Ford.&nbsp;<br><br> With these excerpts from her handwritten notebooks, <i>The Princess Diarist</i> is Fisher&#x2019;s intimate and revealing recollection of what happened on one of the most famous film sets of all time&#x2014;and what developed behind the scenes. Fisher also ponders the joys and insanity of celebrity, and the absurdity of a life spawned by Hollywood royalty, only to be surpassed by her own outer-space royalty. Laugh-out-loud hilarious and endlessly quotable, <i>The Princess Diarist</i> brims with the candor and introspection of a diary while offering shrewd insight into one of Hollywood's most beloved stars.</p><p><b>Carrie Fisher</b> was an author and actress best known for her role as Princess Leia in the <i>Star Wars</i> franchise. She appeared in countless other films, including <i>Shampoo </i>and <i>When Harry Met Sally</i> and wrote four bestselling novels: <i>Surrender the Pink</i>, <i>Delusions of Grandma</i>, <i>The Best Awful,</i> and <i>Postcards from the Edge</i>, as well as the memoirs <i>Shockaholic </i>and<i> Wishful Drinking.</i>&nbsp;She passed away in December 2016.<b>From <i>The Princess Diarist</i>:<br></b><br> George Lucas held his auditions for Star Wars in an office on a lot in Hollywood. It was in one of those faux-Spanish cream-colored buildings from the thirties with dark orange-tiled roofs and black-iron-grated windows, lined with sidewalks in turn lined with trees&#x2014;pine trees, I think they were, the sort that shed their needles generously onto the street below&#x2014;and interrupted by parched patches of once-green lawns. <br> Everything was a little worse for the wear, but good things would happen in these buildings. Lives would be led, businesses would prosper, and men would attend meetings&#x2014;hopeful meetings, meetings where big plans were made and ideas were proposed. But of all the meetings that had ever been held in that particular office, none of them could compare in world impact with the casting calls for the Star Wars movie. <br> A plaque could be placed on the outside of this building that states, &#x201c;On this spot the Star Wars films conducted their casting sessions. In this building the actors and actresses entered and exited until only three remained. These three were the actors who ultimately played the lead parts of Han, Luke, and Leia.&#x201d; <br> I&#x2019;ve told the story of getting cast as Princess Leia many times before&#x2014;in interviews, on horseback, and in cardiac units&#x2014;so if you&#x2019;ve previously heard this story before, I apologize for requiring some of your coveted store of patience. I know how closely most of us tend to hold on to whatever cache of patience we&#x2019;ve managed to amass over a lifetime and I appreciate your squandering some of your cherished stash here.<br> &nbsp;<br> George gave me the impression of being smaller than he was because he spoke so infrequently. I first encountered his all-but-silent presence at these auditions&#x2014;the first of which he held with the director Brian De Palma. Brian was casting his horror film Carrie, and they both required an actress between the age of eighteen and twenty-two. I was the right age at the right time, so I read for both George and Brian.<br> George had directed two other feature films up till then, THX 1138, starring Robert Duvall, and American Graffiti, starring Ron Howard and Cindy Williams. The roles I met with the two directors for that first day were Princess Leia in Star Wars and Carrie in Carrie. I thought that last role would be a funny casting coup if I got it: Carrie as Carrie in Carrie. I doubt that that was why I never made it to the&nbsp;next level with Carrie&#x2014;but it didn&#x2019;t help as far as I was concerned that there would have to be a goofy film poster advertising a serious horror film. <br> I sat down before the two directors behind their respective desks. Mr. Lucas was all but mute. He nodded when I entered the room, and Mr. De Palma took over from there. He was a big man, and not merely because he spoke more&#x2014; or spoke, period. Brian sat on the left and George on the right, both bearded. As if you had two choices in director sizes. Only I didn&#x2019;t have the choice&#x2014;they did. <br> Brian cleared his bigger throat of bigger things and said, &#x201c;So I see here you&#x2019;ve been in the film Shampoo?&#x201d; <br> I knew this, so I simply nodded, my face in a tight white-toothed smile. Maybe they would ask me something requiring more than a nod. <br> &#x201c;Did you enjoy working with Warren?&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Yes, I did!&#x201d; That was easy! I had enjoyed working with him, but Brian&#x2019;s look told me that wasn&#x2019;t enough of an answer. &#x201c;He was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; <br> What was he? They needed to know! &#x201c;He helped me work&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a lot. I mean, he and the other screenwriter&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they worked with me.&#x201d; Oh my God, this wasn&#x2019;t going well. <br> Mr. De Palma waited for more, and when more wasn&#x2019;t forthcoming, he attempted to help me. &#x201c;How did they work with you?&#x201d; <br> Oh, that&#x2019;s what they wanted to know! &#x201c;They had me do the scene over and over, and with food. There was eating in the scene. I had to offer Warren a baked apple and then I ask him if he&#x2019;s making it with my mother&#x2014;sleeping with her&#x2014;you know.&#x201d; <br> George almost smiled; Brian actually did. &#x201c;Yes, I know what &#x2018;making it&#x2019; means.&#x201d;<br> I flushed. I considered stopping this interview then and there. But I soldiered on. <br> &#x201c;No, no, that&#x2019;s the dialogue. &#x2018;Are you making it with my mother?&#x2019; I asked him that because I hate my mother. Not in real life, I hate my mother in the movie, partly because she is sleeping with Warren&#x2014;who&#x2019;s the hairdresser. Lee Grant played my mom, but I didn&#x2019;t really have any scenes with her, which is too bad because she&#x2019;s a great actress. And Warren is a great actor and he also wrote the movie, with Robert Towne, which is why they both worked with me. With food. It sounded a lot more natural when you talk with food in your mouth. Not that you do that in your movies. Maybe in the scary movie, but I don&#x2019;t know the food situation in space.&#x201d; The meeting seemed to be going better. <br> &#x201c;What have you done since Shampoo?&#x201d; George asked.<br> &nbsp;I repressed the urge to say I had written three symphonies and learned how to perform dental surgery on monkeys, and instead told the truth. <br> &#x201c;I went to school in England. Drama school. I went to the Central School of Speech and Drama.&#x201d; I was breathless with information. &#x201c;I mean I didn&#x2019;t just go, I&#x2019;m still going. I&#x2019;m home on Christmas vacation.&#x201d; <br> I stopped abruptly to breathe. Brian was nodding, his eyebrows headed off to his hair in something like surprise. He asked me politely about my experience at school, and I responded politely as George watched impassively. (I would come to discover that George&#x2019;s expression wasn&#x2019;t indifferent or anything like it. It was shy and discerning, among many other things, including intelligent, studious, and&#x2014; and a word like &#x201c;darling.&#x201d; Only not that word, because it&#x2019;s too young and androgynous, and besides which, and most important, George would hate it.)<br> &#x201c;What do you plan on doing if you get one of these jobs you&#x2019;re meeting on?&#x201d; continued Brian. <br> &#x201c;I mean, it really would depend on the part, but&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; . I guess I&#x2019;d leave. I mean I know I would. Because I mean&#x2014;&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;I know what you mean,&#x201d; Brian interrupted. The meeting continued but I was no longer fully present&#x2014;utterly convinced that I&#x2019;d screwed up by revealing myself to be so disloyal. Leave my school right in the middle for the first job that came along? <br> Soon after, we were done. I shook each man&#x2019;s hand as I moved to the door, leading off to the gallows of obscurity. George&#x2019;s hand was firm and cool. <br> I returned to the outer office knowing full well that I would be going back to school. &#x201c;Miss Fisher,&#x201d; a casting assistant said. I froze, or would have, if we weren&#x2019;t in sunny Los Angeles. &#x201c;Here are your sides. Two doors down. You&#x2019;ll read on video.&#x201d; My heart pounded everywhere a pulse can get to. <br> The scene from Carrie involved the mother (who would be memorably played by Piper Laurie). A dark scene, where the people are not okay. But the scene in Star Wars&#x2014;there were no mothers there! There was authority and confidence and command in the weird language that was used. Was I like this? Hopefully George would think so, and I could pretend I thought so, too. I could pretend I was a princess whose life went from chaos to crisis without looking down between chaoses to find, to her relief, that her dress wasn&#x2019;t torn.<br> &nbsp;<br> I have no recollection now of how I felt reading the two scenes. I can only assume I beat myself up loud and long. Did they like me? Did they think I was fat? Did they think I looked like a bowl of oatmeal with features? Four little dark dots in one big flat pale face (&#x201c;Me pale face&#x2014;you Tonto&#x201d;). Did they think I looked pretty enough? Was I likable enough for me to relax at all? Not on your life. Because (a) there was no relaxing anywhere in my general area, and (b) there was no relaxing anywhere in show business. <br> But George must have thought I did well enough to have me back. They sent me the Star Wars script so I could practice it before the last reading. I remember opening the manila envelope it came in very carefully, one edge at a time, before removing its unknown cargo. It didn&#x2019;t look any different from other scripts&#x2014;cardboard-like paper on each end, protecting the ordinary paper within&#x2014;covered in antlike scratches of letters. I don&#x2019;t know why, but I wanted to read this screenplay out loud. <br> Enter Miguel Ferrer. Miguel wasn&#x2019;t certain that he wanted to be an actor yet&#x2014;like me. But we were both intrigued enough that we continued exploring. Like me, he came from a show business background. His father was the actor Jos� Ferrer and his mother the singer/actress Rosemary Clooney. We were friends, and I called him up and asked him to read this script with me. He arrived at my mother&#x2019;s newer, much smaller house&#x2014;since her dramatically reduced financial circumstances due to a second failed marriage&#x2014;and we went to my bedroom on the second floor. <br> Like every young man wanting to be an actor in Hollywood then, he had also read for the film, so both of us were dimly aware what we were in store for. We sat on my bed and began to read. From the first page&#x2014;STAR WARS: A SPACE FANTASY&#x2014;the images and characters jumped off the pages. Not only into our minds, but into the chairs and other furniture that surrounded us. I&#x2019;m exaggerating (a little) but it could have jumped onto the furniture, eaten all of it, and drank the blood of an Englishman&#x2014;because it was as epic as any fee-fi-fo-fum rhyme you ever heard. <br> The images of space opened around us, planets and stars floated by. The character I was reading for, Leia, was kidnapped by the evil Darth Vader&#x2014;kidnapped and hung upside down when the smuggler pilot Han Solo (who Miguel was reading for) and his giant monkey creature copilot Chewbacca rescued me. I had been (in the script) upside down and unconscious with yellow eyes. I&#x2019;ll never forget that image. Whoever got the part of the princess named Leia would get to do this. I would potentially get to do this! Maybe&#x2014;if I was lucky&#x2014;I would be rescued by Han and Chewbacca (Chewie!) from the caverns underneath wherever they&#x2019;d tortured me, and Chewie would carry me, slung over his shoulder through thigh deep water as we made it out of (interplanetary) harm&#x2019;s way.<br> Unfortunately, none of this imagery was ever realized due to a combination of cost and the fact that Peter Mayhew&#x2014;who they hired to play Chewie&#x2014;couldn&#x2019;t do the stunt due to his extreme height of over 7 feet. He had a condition that left him unable to stand up quickly and remain stable; it was impossible for him to lift up weight of any kind. And my weight, as everyone at Lucasland can recall, was, and remains, of the &#x201c;any kind&#x201d; variety. <br> But I can safely say that any girl cast in the part of the feisty Princess Leia would&#x2019;ve been of the any kind size&#x2014; because once Peter was cast, the lifting and being carried through those thigh-high drenched caverns was out. But I also recall hearing that the water-engulfed caverns were quite an expensive set to build, and this was a low-budget film, so they were out for that reason&#x2014;leaving only Leia&#x2019;s unconsciousness and those yellow eyes. Most of us know how inexpensive unconsciousness is or was to achieve, so that wouldn&#x2019;t have been a budget problem&#x2014;just inappropriate. But by the time you lose Peter&#x2019;s inability to carry any feisty princess and consider the cost-ineffective underground water caverns&#x2014;it doesn&#x2019;t matter how beautifully you can portray insensibility&#x2014;it ain&#x2019;t happening anyway. <br> The Force was put in me (in a non-invasive way) by the script that day with Miguel, and it has remained in me ever since. I ended up reading for the film with a new actor, an actor I&#x2019;d never seen before, but then he had never seen me, either. I&#x2019;ll bet since that reading with me he&#x2019;s rued the day&#x2014;if he can get his strong hands on a rue that is&#x2014;and if anyone could get their hands on a rue or a Woo it was Harrison Ford. We read together in a room in that same building I&#x2019;d met George and Brian De Palma in. I was so nervous about the reading I don&#x2019;t remember much about Harrison, and given how nervous Harrison would come to make me, that was plenty frightened indeed.<br> The following week, my agent, a man who&#x2019;d been my mother&#x2019;s agent, Wilt Melnick, and was now mine, called me. <br> &#x201c;Carrie?&#x201d; he asked. <br> I knew my name. So I let him know I knew it. &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; I said in a voice very like mine. Mine but hollow, mine but it didn&#x2019;t matter because my stomach had swung into action. <br> &#x201c;They called,&#x201d; he said. <br> Great, &#x2019;cause that was really all I wanted to know. If they called, that they called, not what they said&#x2014;that didn&#x2019;t matter. <br> &#x201c;They want you,&#x201d; he continued. <br> There was a silence. <br> &#x201c;They do? I mean they did?&#x201d; <br> He laughed, then I laughed and dropped the phone and ran out into the front yard and into the street. It was raining. It didn&#x2019;t rain in L.A. It was raining in L.A. and I was Princess Leia. I had never been Princess Leia before and now I would be her forever. I would never not be Princess Leia. I had no idea how profoundly true that was and how long forever was. <br> They would pay me nothing and fly me economy&#x2014;a fact that would haunt my mother for months&#x2014;but I was Leia and that was all that truly mattered. I&#x2019;m Leia&#x2014;I can live in a tree, but you can&#x2019;t take that away from me. <br> I never dreamt there actually might be a day when I maybe hoped that you could</p><h2>Song of Solomon (Everyman&#39;s Library)</h2><p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this celebrated novel, Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison created a new way of rendering the contradictory nuances of black life in America. Its earthy poetic language and striking use of folklore and myth established Morrison as a major voice in contemporary fiction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Song of Solomon</i> begins with one of the most arresting scenes in our century's literature: a dreamlike tableau depicting a man poised on a roof, about to fly into the air, while cloth rose petals swirl above the snow-covered ground and, in the astonished crowd below, one woman sings as another enters premature labor. The child born of that labor, Macon (Milkman) Dead, will eventually come to discover, through his complicated progress to maturity, the meaning of the drama that marked his birth. Toni Morrison's novel is at once a romance of self-discovery, a retelling of the black experience in America that uncovers the inalienable poetry of that experience, and a family saga luminous in its depth, imaginative generosity, and universality. It is also a tribute to the ways in which, in the hands of a master, the ancient art of storytelling can be used to make the mysterious and invisible aspects of human life apparent, real, and firm to the touch.</p></p><p>The third novel from one America's most powerful writers turns 20 years old in 1997, but <i>Song of Solomon</i> long ago ascended to the top shelf in the ranks of great literature. This Everyman's Library hardcover edition of the Nobel Prize-winning Morrison's lyrical, powerful, and erudite novel contains a chronology that situates the book in its historical context, and an introduction from author Reynolds Price."A stunningly beautiful book . . . I would call the book poetry, but that would seem to be denying its considerable power as a story. Whatever name you give it, it's full of magnificent people, each of them complex and multilayered, even the narrowest of them narrow in extravagant ways."<br>--Anne Tyler<br><b>Washington Post Book World</b><p>"Morrison's prose is a delight, full of the lyrical variety and allusiveness that distinguish a rich folkloric tradition. Her real gift, though, is for characterization, and Song of Solomon is peopled with an amazing collection of losers and fighters, innocents and murderers, followers of ghosts and followers of money, all of whom add to the pleasure of this exceptionally diverse novel."<br>--<b>The Atlantic Monthly</b></p><p>"Morrison moves easily in and out of the lives and thoughts of her characters, luxuriating in the diversity of circumstance and personality, and reveling in the sound of their voices and of her own, which echoes and elaborates theirs."<br>--<b>The New Yorker</b></p><p>"Exuberant . . . An artistic vision that encompasses both a private and a national heritage."<br>--<b>Time</b></p><p>"A fine novel exuberantly constructed . . .

June 15], 1869 &#x2013; May 14, 1940) was an anarchist known for her political activism, writing, and speeches. She played a pivotal role in the development of anarchist political philosophy in North America and Europe in the first half of the 20th century. Born in Kovno in the Russian Empire (present-day Kaunas, Lithuania), Goldman emigrated to the U.S. in 1885 and lived in New York City, where she joined the burgeoning anarchist movement in 1889. Attracted to anarchism after the Haymarket affair, Goldman became a writer and a renowned lecturer on anarchist philosophy, women's rights, and social issues, attracting crowds of thousands. She and anarchist writer Alexander Berkman, her lover and lifelong friend, planned to assassinate industrialist and financier Henry Clay Frick as an act of propaganda of the deed. Although Frick survived the attempt on his life, Berkman was sentenced to 22 years in prison. Goldman was imprisoned several times in the years that followed, for "inciting to riot" and illegally distributing information about birth control. In 1906, Goldman founded the anarchist journal Mother Earth.</p><h2>Gone (Gone, 1)</h2><p><p><strong>The first in <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Michael Grant's breathtaking dystopian sci-fi saga, <em>Gone</em> is a page-turning thriller that invokes the classic <em>The Lord of the Flies</em> along with the horror of Stephen King.</strong></p><p>In the blink of an eye, everyone disappears.

In the Kalahari Desert, a nun unearths evidence of a proto-human species and a deity called Older-than-Old. In Bosnia, something has been feeding upon the dead in a mass grave. So begins mankind&#x2019;s most shocking realization: that the underworld is a vast geological labyrinth populated by another race of beings. Some call them devils or demons. But they are real. They are down there. And they are waiting for us to find them...</p><p>In a high Himalayan cave, among the death pits of Bosnia, in a newly excavated Java temple, Long's characters find out to their terror that humanity is not alone--that, as we have always really known, horned and vicious humanoids lurk in vast caverns beneath our feet. This audacious remaking of the old hollow-earth plot takes us, in no short order, to the new world regime that follows the genocidal harrowing of Hell by heavily armed, high-tech American forces. An ambitious tycoon sends an expedition of scientists, including a beautiful nun linguist and a hideously tattooed commando former prisoner of Hell, ever deeper into the unknown, among surviving, savage, horned tribes and the vast citadels of the civilizations that fell beneath the earth before ours arose. A conspiracy of scholars pursues the identity of the being known as Satan, coming up with unpalatable truths about the origins of human culture and the identity of the Turin Shroud, and are picked off one by bloody one. Long rehabilitates, madly, the novel of adventures among lost peoples--occasional clumsiness and promises of paranoid revelations on which he cannot entirely deliver fail to diminish the real achievement here; this feels like a story we have always known and dreaded. <i>--Roz Kaveney, Amazon.co.uk</i>"Jeff Long has written a remarkable novel, an imaginative tour de force that somehow succeeds both as sober-minded allegory and nail-biting thriller.

Long writes with force and unearthly vision, etching vivid characters who speak in an all-too-realistic manner about the horrors they encounter. What emerges is a War of the Worlds against a world that can't lose. With <b>The Descent</b>, Jeff Long has delivered what is bound to be this summer's really hot read.

The settlers were unprepared for the hardships they would face at the end of their journey, but with the help of their neighbor Indians, the Pilgrims survived the first year in their new world. Then, when their fall harvest was plentiful, the Pilgrims and the Indians joined together in a three-day celebration, the first Thanksgiving.</p></p><p><p>Diane Z. Shore and Jessica Alexander have collaborated on several children's books, including <em>This Is the Dream</em> and <em>This Is the Game</em>. One thing they have learned while cowriting stories is that when people work together, great things can happen. Both authors live with their families in metro Atlanta, Georgia.</p><br><br><p>Megan Lloyd has illustrated more than forty books for children, including <em>The Little Old Lady Who Was Not Afraid of Anything</em> by Linda Williams, <em>Thanksgiving at the Tappletons'</em> by Eileen Spinelli, and <em>The Mixed-Up Rooster</em> by Pamela Duncan Edwards. She lives with her husband on a farm in Pennsylvania, where she raises sheep, chickens, and cows. Some of the rabbits from her vegetable garden have even been kind enough to allow Ms. Lloyd to sketch them as models for this book.</p>Grade 2&#x2013;5&#x2014;The epic tale of the Pilgrims' first year at the Plymouth settlement is told in verse. Beginning with the <i>Mayflower</i>'s journey across the ocean and concluding with the three-day harvest celebration and feast, the struggles and successes of the year are described. Each good turn of events is commemorated with a "Thanks be to God..." appropriate to the Pilgrims' religious motives. The difficult journey and early loss of lives are mentioned along with the discovery of the cleared Patuxet fields and baskets of corn. Squanto, "this wise, clever man," is given credit for helping the Pilgrims by teaching them the skills they needed to survive. It's during the "Feast the Pilgrims prepared" that some long-standing inaccuracies are most apparent. How the Indians participated in and contributed to the Thanksgiving celebration is reduced to the statement that they "shared in the singing and dancing." This omission flaws an otherwise mostly balanced retelling of one of our country's earliest stories. Richly colored and detailed illustrations match the proportions of the events; however, the mentions of "death and disease" and "days of despair" are not reflected in the pictures. Only one apparently ill man is shown amid a room full of robust women and children preparing a meal of roasted fowl and fresh produce. Kate Waters's <i>Giving Thanks: The 1621 Harvest Feast</i> (Scholastic, 2001) and Joseph Bruchac's <i>Squanto's Journey: The Story of the First Thanksgiving</i> (Harcourt, 2000) are better.

Thompson. In letters to a Who&#39;s Who of luminaries from Norman Mailer to Charles Kuralt, Tom Wolfe to Lyndon Johnson, William Styron to Joan Baez--not to mention his mother, the NRA, and a chain of newspaper editors--Thompson vividly catches the tenor of the times in 1960s America and channels it all through his own razor-sharp perspective. Passionate in their admiration, merciless in their scorn, and never anything less than fascinating, the dispatches of The Proud Highway offer an unprecedented and penetrating gaze into the evolution of the most outrageous raconteur/provocateur ever to assault a typewriter.</p><p>This first volume of the correspondence of Hunter S. Thompson begins with a high school essay and runs up through the publication of Thompson's breakout book, <i>Hell's Angels</i>. Thompson apparently never threw a letter away, so the reader has the treat of experiencing the full evolution of his pyrotechnic writing style, rant by rant. The letters--to girlfriends, to bill collectors, to placers of "Help Wanted" ads, to editors and publishers--are usually spiced with political commentary. The style and the political animus always seem to drive each other. For instance, an 11/22/63 letter to novelist and friend William J. Kennedy about the day's cataclysm is apparently the birthplace of the signal phrase "fear and loathing." (Thompson summed up the Kennedy assassination thus: "The savage nuts have shattered the great myth of American decency.") And the willingness to write strangers is stunning: this collection includes Thompson's letter to LBJ seeking appointment to the governorship of American Samoa. You might have thought Garry Trudeau was exaggerating in his <i>Doonesbury</i> characterization of the Thompson-based character Duke. He was not.I recommended this one to my twenty-five-year old brother. Some of what I saw inside the book seemed to cater to his sense of humor and his desire for the truth. He loved it. He told me he read it on the plane on a business trip and couldn't put it down.<br><br>Eileen Gaffney, Associate Managing Editor</p><h2>Fields Without Dreams : Defending the Agrarian Ideal</h2><p>Eulogizing the vanishing lifestyle of the family farm, Victor Hanson calls for America to take notice of its lost simplicity and purity before it is too late. &#34;Victor Davis Hanson . . . is a writer as much as a farmer.

He takes his classics seriously, likening the raisin farmers of Modesto to Aeschylus&#39; ideal virtuous man, who &#34;did not wish to seem just, but to be so.&#34; He takes modern cultural dictates less seriously: &#34;Is it not odd,&#34; he writes, &#34;to rise at dawn with Japanese-, Mexican-, Pakistani-, Armenian-, and Portuguese-American farmers and then be lectured at noonday 40 miles away on campus about cultural sensitivity and the need for &#39;diversity&#39; by the affluent white denizens of an exclusive, tree-studded suburb?&#34; Hanson relates the life stories of his farmer neighbors, writing that their way of life will likely soon disappear, thanks in part to a federal system of agricultural subsidies that favors large-scale, industrial farm corporations over individual &#34;yeomen.&#34; This is a sobering and eye-opening book.Victor Davis Hanson is Professor of Greek at California State University in Fresno.</p><h2>Fruits Basket Another, Vol. 1 (Fruits Basket Another, 1)</h2><p>Sawa Mitoma, a shy and unconfident girl, has just started high school, and it's already not going well...until she makes friends meets the President and Vice-President of the student council.

The hinayana introduces core Buddhist teachings on the nature of mind, the practice of meditation, the reality of suffering, and the possibility of liberation. It examines the nature of suffering, impermanence, and egolessness, with an emphasis on personal development through meditative discipline and study. The formal entry into the hinayana and the Buddhist path altogether is the refuge vow, in which a student goes for refuge to the Buddha, or the teacher; the dharma, or the teachings; and the sangha, or the community. The hinayana path is based on training in mindfulness and awareness, cultivating virtue, and cutting grasping. <br><br>Topics covered in detail in this volume include the four noble truths, karma, the four foundations of mindfulness, meditation practice, the refuge vows, the three jewels, the five skandhas, the five precepts, twofold egolessness, and more.<br><br><i>The Profound Treasury of the Ocean of Dharma</i> represents meditation master Ch�gyam Trungpa&#x2019;s greatest contribution to Western Buddhism.

Wrongly accused of theft and exiled from a religious community many years before, the embittered weaver Silas Marner lives alone in Raveloe, living only for work and his precious hoard of money. But when his money is stolen and an orphaned child finds her way into his house, Silas is given the chance to transform his life. His fate, and that of Eppie, the little girl he adopts, is entwined with Godfrey Cass, son of the village Squire, who, like Silas, is trapped by his past. Silas Marner, George Eliot&#39;s favourite of her novels, combines humour, rich symbolism and pointed social criticism to create an unsentimental but affectionate portrait of rural life. This text uses the Cabinet edition, revised by George Eliot in 1878. David Carroll&#39;s introduction is complemented by the original Penguin Classics edition introduction by Q.D. Leavis. Mary Ann Evans (1819-80) began her literary career as a translator, and later editor, of the Westminster Review. In 1857, she published Scenes of Clerical Life, the first of eight novels she would publish under the name of &#39;George Eliot&#39;, including The Mill on the Floss, Middlemarch, and Daniel Deronda. If you enjoyed Silas Marner, you might like Nathaniel Hawthorne&#39;s The Scarlet Letter, also available in Penguin Classics. &#39;I think Silas Marner holds a higher place than any of the author&#39;s works.

It will include novels, poetry, short stories, essays, travel-writing and other non-fiction. The series will be extensive and open-ended and will provide school students with a range of edited texts taken from a wide geographical spread.Embittered by a false accusation, disappointed in friendship and love, the weaver Silas Marner retreats into a long twilight life alone with his loom. . . and his gold. Silas hoards a treasure that kills his spirit until fate steals it from him and replaces it with a golden-haired founding child. Where she came from, who her parents were, and who really stole the gold are the secrets that permeate this moving tale of guilt and innocence. A moral allegory of the redemptive power of love, it is also a finely drawn picture of early nineteenth-century England in the days when spinning wheels hummed busily in the farmhouses, and of a simple way of life that was soon to disappear.<p></p><p>"I think <i>Silas Marner</i> holds a higher place than any of the author's works.

All night she had lain motionless in the massive four-poster bed, unable to sleep, the stillness of the house oppressive and clutching.</p> <p>Even after weeks of knowing it would not come, her ears were still tuned for the baby's hungry cry. Her breasts still filled, ready to welcome the tiny, eager lips.</p> <p>Finally she switched on the lamp at the bedside table. The room brightened and the leaded crystal bowl on the dresser top caught and reflected the light. The small cakes of pine soap that filled the bowl cast an eerie green tint on the antique silver mirror and brushes. </p> <p>She got out of bed and began to dress, choosing the long underwear and nylon Windbreaker that she wore under her ski suit. She had turned on the radio at four o'clock. The weather report was unchanged for the area of Granite Place, Minnesota; the temperature was twelve degrees Fahrenheit. The winds were blowing at an average of twenty-five miles per hour. The windchill factor was twenty-four below zero. </p> <p>It didn't matter. Nothing mattered. If she froze to death in the search she would try to find the cabin. Somewhere in that forest of maples and oaks and evergreens and Norwegian pines and overgrown brush it was there. In those sleepless hours she had devised a plan. Erich could walk three paces to her one. His naturally long stride had always made him unconsciously walk too fast for her. They used to joke about it. "Hey, wait up for a city girl," she'd protest. </p> <p>Once he had forgotten his key when he went to the cabin and immediately returned to the house for it. He'd been gone forty minutes. That meant that for him the cabin was usually about a twenty-minute walk from the edge of the woods. </p> <p>He had never taken her there. "Please understand, Jenny," he'd begged. "Every artist needs a place to be totally alone." </p> <p>She had never tried to find it before. The help on the farm was absolutely forbidden to go into the woods. Even Clyde, who'd been the farm manager for 30 years, claimed he didn't know where the cabin was. </p> <p>The heavy, crusted snow would have erased any path, but the snow also made it possible for her to try the search on cross-country skis. She'd have to be careful not to get lost. With the dense underbrush and her own miserable sense of direction, she could easily go around in circles. </p> <p>Jenny had thought about that, and decided to take a compass, a hammer, tacks and pieces of cloth. She could nail the cloth to trees to help her find her way back. </p> <p>Her ski suit was downstairs in the closet off the kitchen. While water boiled for coffee, she zipped it on. The coffee helped to bring her mind into focus. During the night she had considered going to Sheriff Gunderson. But he would surely refuse help and would simply stare at her with that familiar look of speculative disdain. </p> <p>She would carry a thermos of coffee with her. She didn't have a key to the cabin, but she could break a window with the hammer. </p> <p>Even though Elsa had not been in for over two weeks, the huge old house still glistened and shone with visible proof of her rigid standards of cleanliness. Her habit as she left was to tear off the current day from the daily calendar over the wall phone. Jenny had joked about that to Erich. "She not only cleans what was never dirty, she eliminates every weekday evening." </p> <p>Now Jenny tore off Friday, February 14, crumpled the page in her hand and stared at the blank sheet under the bold lettering, Saturday, February 15. She shivered. It was nearly 14 months since that day in the gallery when she'd met Erich. No that couldn't be. It was a lifetime ago. She rubbed her hand across her forehead. </p> <p>Her chestnut-brown hair had darkened to near-black during the pregnancy. It felt drab and lifeless as she stuffed it under the woolen ski cap. The shell-edged mirror to the left of the kitchen door was an incongruous touch in the massive, oak-beamed kitchen. She stared into it now. Her eyes were heavily shadowed. Normally a shade somewhere between aqua and blue, they reflected back at her wide-pupiled and expressionless. Her cheeks were drawn. The weight loss since the birth had left her too thin. The pulse in her neck throbbed as she zipped the ski suit to the top. Twenty-seven years old. It seemed to her that she looked at least ten years older, and felt a century older. If only the numbness would go away. If only the house weren't so quiet, so fearfully, frighteningly quiet. </p> <p>She looked at the cast-iron stove at the east wall of the kitchen. The cradle, filled with wood, was beside it again, its usefulness restored. </p> <p>Deliberately she studied the cradle, made herself absorb the constant shock of its presence in the kitchen, then turned her back on it and reached for the thermos bottle. She poured coffee into it, then collected the compass, hammer and tacks and strips of cloth. Thrusting them into a canvas knapsack she pulled a scarf over her face, put on her cross-country ski shoes, yanked thick, fur-lined mittens on her hands and opened the door. </p> <p>The sharp, biting wind made a mockery of the face scarf. The muffled lowing of the cows in the dairy barn reminded her of the exhausted sobs of deep mourning. The sun was coming up, dazzling against the snow, harsh in its golden-red beauty, a far-off god that could not affect the bitter cold. </p> <p>By now Clyde would be inspecting the dairy barn. Other hands would be pitching hay in the polebarns to feed the scores of black Angus cattle, which were unable to graze beneath the hard-packed snow and would habitually head there for food and shelter. A half-dozen men working on this enormous farm, yet there was no one near the house -- all of them were small figures, seen like silhouettes, against the horizon.... </p> <p>Her cross-country skis were outside the kitchen door. Jenny carried them down the six steps from the porch, tossed them on the ground, stepped into them and snapped them on. Thank God she'd learned to ski well last year. </p> <p>It was a little after seven o'clock when she began looking for the cabin. She limited herself to skiing no more than thirty minutes in any direction. She started at the point where Erich always disappeared into the woods. The overhead branches were so entangled that the sun barely penetrated through them. After she'd skied in as straight a line as possible, she turned right, covered about one hundred feet more, turned right again and started back to the edge of the forest. The wind covered her tracks almost as soon as she passed any spot but at every turning point she hammered a piece of cloth into the tree. </p> <p>At eleven o'clock she returned to the house, heated soup, changed into dry socks, forced herself to ignore the tingling pain in her forehead and hands, and set out again. </p> <p>At five o'clock, half frozen, the slanting rays of the sun almost vanishing, she was about to give up for the day when she decided to go over one more hilly mound. It was then she came upon it, the small, bark-roofed log cabin that had been built by Erich's great-grandfather in 1869. She stared at it, biting her lips as savage disappointment sliced her with the physical impact of a stiletto. </p> <p>The shades were drawn; the house had a shuttered look as though it had not been open for a time. The chimney was snow-covered; no lights shone from within. </p> <p>Had she really dared to hope that when she came upon it, that chimney would be smoking, lamps would glow through the curtains, that she'd be able to go up to the door and open it? </p> <p>There was a metal shingle nailed to the door. The letters were faded but still readable: ABSOLUTELY NO ADMITTANCE. VIOLATORS WILL BE PROSECUTED. It was signed Erich Fritz Krueger and dated 1903. </p> <p>There was a pump house to the left of the cabin, an outhouse discreetly half-hidden by full-branched pines. She tried to picture the young Erich coming here with his mother. "Caroline loved the cabin just as it was," Erich had told her. "My father wanted to modernize the old place but she wouldn't hear of it." </p> <p>No longer aware of the cold, Jenny skied over to the nearest window. Reaching into the knapsack, she pulled out the hammer, raised it and smashed the pane. Flying glass grazed her cheek She was unaware of the trickle of blood that froze as it ran down her face. Careful to avoid the jagged peaks, she reached in, unfastened the latch and shoved the window up. </p> <p>Kicking offher skis, she climbed over the low sill, pushed aside the shade and stepped into the cabin. The cabin consisted of a single room about twenty feet square. A Franklin stove on the north wall had wood piled neatly next to it. A faded Oriental rug covered most of the white pine flooring. A wide-armed, high-backed velour couch and matching chairs were clustered around the stove. A long oak table and benches were near the front windows. A spinning wheel looked as though it might still be functional. A massive oak sideboard held willowware china and oil lamps. A steep stairway led to the left. Next to it, rows of file baskets held stacks of unframed canvases. The walls were white pine, unknotted, silk-smooth and covered with paintings. Numbly Jenny walked from one to the other of them. The cabin was a museum. Even the dim light could not hide the exquisite beauty of the oils and watercolors, the charcoals and pen-and-ink drawings. Erich had not even begun to show his best work yet. How would the critics react when they saw these masterpieces? she wondered. </p> <p>Some of the paintings on the walls were already framed. These must be the next ones he planned to exhibit. The pole-barn in a winter storm. What was so different about it? The doe, head poised, listening, about to flee into the woods. The calf reaching up to its mother. The fields of alfalfa, blue-flowered, ready for harvest. The Congregational Church with worshipers hurrying toward it. The main street of Granite Place suggesting timeless serenity. </p> <p>Even in her desolation, the sensitive beauty of the collection gave Jenny a momentary sense of quietude and peace. </p> <p>Finally she bent over the unframed canvases in the nearest rack. Again admiration suffused her being. The incredible...</p></p><h2>Apocalypse (Star Wars: Fate of the Jedi - Legends)</h2><p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> In the stunning finale of the epic Fate of the Jedi series, Jedi and Sith face off&#x2014;with Coruscant as their battlefield.

Through a thousand centuries of strife, those lights had continued to shine. Nothing had dimmed their brilliance&#x2014; not the Rakatan enslavement, not the tyranny of the Empire, not the chaos of civil war. And they continued to shine now, in this new age of creeping shadow, when enemy impostors ruled the Galactic Alliance and Sith Lords slept in the Jedi Temple itself. But all those gleaming lights made Jaina Solo wonder whether Coruscant&#x2019;s trillion residents actually cared who won the coming war&#x2014;whether it mattered that they were living under Sith rule, so long as those billion lights continued to shine. <br><br>The answer came to her almost instantly, in the form of a dark tinge in the Force that could only mean Sith. Jaina shifted her gaze to the interior of the starliner, where a teeming mass of passengers hung floating in their transit harnesses, tethered to the walls of the EconoClass hold. Floating down the central access aisle was a Coruscanti Immigration inspector, his zero-g motility pack emitting small hisses as he twirled in slow-motion cartwheels, demanding identichips and ten- credit &#x201c;expediting fees.&#x201d; Behind him followed a pair of Bothan escorts, their snouts wrinkling in disdain each time their superior solicited another bribe. <br><br>Jaina would have liked to believe the inspector was merely a greedy Sith Saber trying to line his pockets, but she knew better. Vestara Khai, newly defected from the Lost Tribe of Sith, had warned the assault teams to take nothing for granted. In her briefings, Vestara had emphasized that the Sith were not stupid. After insinuating themselves in the Galactic Alliance Senate, they would have moved quickly to take control of the Coruscanti Immigration Service and other key bureaucracies. They would expect the Jedi to be coming, and they would be on the lookout for infiltrators&#x2014;and petty extortion was an ideal cover for someone trying to identify enemy agents. <br><br>The inspector stopped near a pair of human siblings in their late twenties. Both were slender and good-looking, with wary eyes and small expressive mouths. The sister&#x2019;s hair was reddish brown, the brother&#x2019;s merely brown. Their fierce loyalty to each other showed in the way they remained shoulder-to-shoulder when they turned to face the immigration team. <br><br>The inspector oriented himself to the same attitude as the siblings&#x2014; head-down relative to Jaina&#x2014;and studied the pair without speaking or reaching for their travel documents. The unexpected change of routine sent a cold ripple through Jaina, but she quickly let out a calming breath and forced herself to relax. Allowing her alarm to permeate the Force would only confirm to the inspector that he had found some- thing worth investigating. <br><br>The siblings, Jedi Knights Valin and Jysella Horn, continued to hold their documents, doing a good job of looking like ordinary passengers who were a little bit nervous. The inspector narrowed his eyes and waited, giving them a chance to betray themselves by doing some- thing foolish. Jaina would probably never learn exactly what had caught the Sith&#x2019;s attention, but she did know that it pointed to the one weakness of the Jedi Masters&#x2019; attack plan. These Sith were both careful and capable, and they outnumbered the Jedi ten to one.<br>Finally, the inspector said, &#x201c;Documents.&#x201d; <br><br>Valin and Jysella extended their hands, each holding a small packet containing a fare receipt, a forged identichip, and the expediting fee. The inspector took Jysella&#x2019;s packet, then slid her chip into a handheld reader and compared it with the point of origin listed on the fare receipt. <br><br>&#x201c;You were born on Kalla Seven?&#x201d; the inspector asked. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; Jysella lied. &#x201c;My brother and I both.&#x201d; <br><br>The inspector glanced at Valin, then asked him, &#x201c;Is this a family trip?&#x201d; <br><br>Valin shook his head. &#x201c;No, my sister and I are traveling alone.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Is that so?&#x201d; The questions were the mundane sort that customs officers all over the galaxy used to probe for story discrepancies. But the real test would be taking place on another level, Jaina knew, with the inspector searching their Force auras for the sour hint of a lie. &#x201c;Then you&#x2019;ve come to visit family?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Jysella replied confidently. Like every Jedi on the assault <br><br>force, she had spent weeks perfecting her ability to lie without betraying herself in the Force. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re tourists.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I see.&#x201d; The inspector glanced at her fare receipt again, then spoke to Valin in a casual voice. &#x201c;Four thousand credits is a lot of money to visit a few monuments and museums. You should have used the HoloNet instead.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;And spend our lives stuck in lower management?&#x201d; Valin retorted. &#x201c;I think not.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;If you haven&#x2019;t been to Coruscant,&#x201d; Jysella added, &#x201c;you go nowhere <br><br>at UHI.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;UHI?&#x201d; the inspector asked. <br><br>&#x201c;Unlimited Horizons Incorporated,&#x201d; she explained, managing to sound just astonished enough to imply that she thought everyone knew what the acronym stood for. &#x201c;You know&#x2014;the UHI that controls most of the pallodenite reserves in the Corporate Sector?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Ah . . . that UHI.&#x201d; The inspector had clearly been put off balance by the tactic&#x2014;just as Vestara had predicted. The Lost Tribe&#x2019;s greatest weakness lay in their inexperience with the greater galaxy. Vestara had said that the quickest way to put a Lost Tribe impostor on the defensive would be to play on that ignorance. &#x201c;There are so many.&#x201d; When the inspector pocketed the bribe and returned Jysella&#x2019;s documents, Jaina finally began to breathe easier. She turned her gaze back to the observation bubble and saw that the Plain Lady was crossing the terminator line into Coruscant&#x2019;s daylight side. It would not be long now, she knew, before she was on the surface, fighting to save her homeworld . . . again.<br>Bazel Warv was &#x201c;Jade Masher,&#x201d; a celebrated Ramoan float wrestler. Seff Hellin was his human manager, and Vaala Razelle was Seff &#x2019;s Arcona assistant. The three had just arrived from a series of grudge matches in the Bothan system, and they were passing through the Galactic Center Spaceport on their way to a championship match at the Iblis Globe. All Bazel had to do was remember all that&#x2014;and believe it. Belief was the key to defeating a Force-user&#x2019;s ability to detect lies. As long as Bazel truly felt like Jade Masher&#x2014;the newest, greatest rising star in the Pan-Galactic Float Wrestling Syndicate&#x2014;he would have no trouble fooling Coruscant&#x2019;s new immigration inspectors. His friend Yaqeel Saav&#x2019;etu had assured him of that. <br><br>Bazel glanced across the sea of heads that were in Arrival Lobby <br><br>757 and found Yaqeel three lines over. She was already at her inspection station, standing alongside another Bothan Jedi, Yantahar Bwua&#x2019;tu. Wearing the ash-gray tabards of businessbeings, the two Jedi Knights were at the front of a long line of passengers waiting to be formally admitted onto a planet that had once greeted visitors with open arms. So far, the Coruscanti populace seemed willing to believe that these new precautions were due to an influx of spice lords, and Bazel was glad. There was no need for the citizens of Coruscant to get hurt&#x2014;not when the Jedi were coming to save them. <br><br>But first the Jedi had to get past the inspection stations, and that part of the plan wasn&#x2019;t going well for Yaqeel and Yantahar. Their Duros immigration inspector had been joined by his captain, a narrow-eyed blond whom Bazel judged to be fairly beautiful for a human. She was firing questions at the Bothans faster than they could answer. Meanwhile, a squad of body-armored Galactic Alliance Security guards were standing ready at a nearby security post. Clearly, something was wrong.<br>Bazel cocked an ear in Yaqeel&#x2019;s direction, consciously tuning out the general din of the lobby and opening himself to the Force. A cool haze of fear permeated the line a few meters behind him, but he had been sensing that off and on since debarking the starliner. There did not seem to be anything menacing in the aura, so he ignored it and focused on the conversation between his friends and the blond immigration captain. His thick hide began to prickle with the bitter margin of a dark side Force aura. Suddenly he understood why his Bothan friends were having trouble. <br><br>Sith. <br><br>Ignoring the growing press of the crowd behind him, Bazel ex- tended his Force awareness toward the security post. To his relief, he felt only the weak auras of non-Force-sensitive guards. The immigration captain was the only Sith in the area&#x2014;probably just a Saber, as- signed to keep watch on the arrival lobby. <br><br>&#x201c;. . . all the way to Coruscant to place an order you could have filled anywhere in the galaxy?&#x201d; the impostor-captain was asking. &#x201c;United Hydrologic Institute is hardly the only Tibanna gas supplier in the Mid Rim.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;But it is the only one with access to Hutt space,&#x201d; Yantahar replied in his gravelly Bothan voice. &#x201c;And since Nar Kagga will be the closest inhabited system to our operation, naturally we want to be certain of our supply chain.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;And your operation will be . . . what, exactly?&#x201d; the blond impostor asked. <br><br>&#x201c;A trade secret, I&#x2019;m afraid.&#x201d; Yaqeel glanced around the inspection <br><br>station, then added, &#x201c;There are spies everywhere, Captain. I&#x2019;m sure you understand.&#x201d; <br><br>The Sith&#x2019;s reply grew inaudible when Bazel&#x2019;s human &#x201c;manager&#x201d; grabbed the huge Ramoan&#x2019;s wrist and asked, &#x201c;Masher, you awake up there?&#x201d; Seff Hellin started forward, trying to pull Bazel into the gap that had opened in the line ahead of them. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re holding things up.&#x201d; Bazel paid no attention, for over at the station where his friends were being questioned, the impostor-captain was looking over Yaqeel&#x2019;s shoulder toward the security post. When the Sith gave a slight nod, the guards drew their stubby Merr-Sonn Urban blaster rifles and started toward the inspection station.<br>Vaala grabbed Bazel by the other wrist. &#x201c;Mighty Masher, sir.&#x201d; The Arcona&#x2019;s voice was soft and bubbly. &#x201c;We really should keep moving.&#x201d; Bazel shook his head, then stepped through the cordon-beams that marked the edge of the queuing area. With matching sighs, Seff and Vaala stepped out of line behind him, each pulling a pair of expensive <br><br>Levalug travel cases that were large enough for Vaala to sleep inside. <br><br>&#x201c;Masher!&#x201d; Seff growled, putting just enough frustration into his voice to sound like a weary manager at the end of his wits. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no time for your temper right now. We have only two hours before the weigh-in.&#x201d; <br><br>They wouldn&#x2019;t be making the weigh-in, Bazel rumbled in his native Ramoan. He could speak Basic when necessary, but his large mouth had trouble shaping the common language&#x2019;s delicate vowels and subtle consonants, and he needed to make himself clearly understood. Yaqeel was in trouble, he explained, and he was not going to leave until she was safe. <br><br>Seff groaned and carefully avoided looking toward Yaqeel and Yantahar. &#x201c;Drawing attention to ourselves won&#x2019;t help anyone, Masher,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Our friends can take care of their own problems.&#x201d; <br><br>As Seff spoke, the GAS guards shouldered their blaster rifles and fanned out behind Yaqeel and Yantahar. The two Bothans reluctantly opened their tabards, and the Sith impostor-captain stepped forward to frisk them. Bazel knew the woman wouldn&#x2019;t find a lightsaber or anything else to identify his two friends as Jedi Knights. The assault team&#x2019;s equipment had been shipped ahead, and it would be returned to them later, by an operative from the Club Bwua&#x2019;tu resistance society. But Bazel also knew the impostor wouldn&#x2019;t be searching his friends at all if she hadn&#x2019;t sensed that something was amiss. He had to find a way to distract her before she confirmed her suspicions . . . a way that wouldn&#x2019;t seem like it was a distraction. <br><br>Vaala clamped a three-fingered hand around one of Bazel&#x2019;s stubby fingers and quietly bent it back against the joint. &#x201c;Mighty Masher, sir, we need to focus on our match.&#x201d; She tried to lead him through the cordon-beams back into the processing line. &#x201c;The, uh, championship is still on, even if a couple of competitors can&#x2019;t make it to the arena.&#x201d; Balling his hand into a fist to stop Vaala from hurting his finger,<br>Bazel remained where he was. If a pair of clever Bothans couldn&#x2019;t make it past the immigration inspectors, he replied quietly, there was no reason to think he could. Besides, they didn&#x2019;t know how many of their peers had already been captured, and if the Sith caught even two teams of infiltrators trying to sneak onto the planet, the Jedi would find themselves attacking without the advantage of surprise, and the battle would grow very big very fast. A lot of innocent civilians would get caught in the crossfire, maybe a million of them, and Bazel wasn&#x2019;t going to allow that. He was going to find another way. <br><br>Seff exhaled in exasperation. &#x201c;What other way?&#x201d; <br><br>Bazel wasn&#x2019;t sure. Maybe he could go on a rampage. That would draw attention away from Yaqeel and Yantahar. <br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think that would be a bit obvious, Mighty Masher, sir?&#x201d; <br><br>asked Vaala. <br><br>Bazel nodded. Tactical planning wasn&#x2019;t his strong point, he re- minded them, but he could tell that Seff and Vaala just wanted to follow orders, and that meant he had to develop his own idea. Maybe he could just bull ahead to the front of the line and try to push past the processing station. <br><br>&#x201c;And get yourself arrested instead?&#x201d; Seff lowered his voice to a whisper. &#x201c;Do you really think you can outwit an interrogator better than a pair of Bothans?&#x201d; <br><br>Bazel had to admit that was unlikely. What he needed was to present the impostor-captain with another reason for the anxiety she seemed to be sensing in Yaqeel&#x2019;s and Yantahar&#x2019;s Force auras. He thought for a moment, then turned back toward the line he had just left and opened himself to the Force. <br><br>Soon he felt the same cool haze of fear he had noticed earlier, a cloud of uncertainty and dismay centered on a small cluster of amphibious Ishi Tib who had clearly not been informed of the new security procedures on Coruscant. The three females were shuffling forward reluctantly, propelled by the pressure of the crowd at their backs, while their male escort was slowly swiveling his eyestalks about, trying to appear casual as he searched for a way to bypass the inspection station. All four carried identical luggage&#x2014;large kaadu-hide traveling cases with matching satchels slung over their shoulders&#x2014;and it was obvious by their reluctance to set their baggage on the floor that they were as worried about losing it as they were about being caught with the contents. <br><br>Spice. <br><br>Bazel stepped back through the cordon-beam. Using the Force, he gently opened a path in front of him, then began to work his way toward the pod of smugglers. Seff and Vaala followed close on his heels, Seff grabbing for his sleeve. <br><br>&#x201c;Masher, the inspection station is the other way.&#x201d; <br><br>Bazel growled that Seff and Vaala should go on. He had a better plan. <br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure changing plans is a good idea at the moment,&#x201d; Vaala objected. &#x201c;The promoters are counting on you.&#x201d; <br><br>The promoters were counting on them all, Bazel reminded her, and if he saw a way to save Yaqeel and Yantahar, he was going to try it. He came to an Aqualish couple who had taken advantage of the path he had opened to sneak forward. The pair glared at him defiantly, daring him to object. He merely shouldered them aside and stepped over to the Ishi Tib, who instinctively shied away and looked as though they were going to flee. <br><br>Bazel distracted them by raising his stubby-fingered hand in a calming gesture, then spoke in Basic, warning them about the securit...</p><h2>The Homebrewed Christianity Guide to Jesus: Lord, Liar, Lunatic . . . Or Awesome? (Homebrewed Christianity, 1)</h2><p>Christology is crazy. It&#39;s rather absurd to identify a first-century homeless Jew as God revealed, but a bunch of us do anyway. In this book, Tripp Fuller examines the historical Jesus, the development of the doctrine of Christ, the questions that drove christological innovations through church history, contemporary constructive proposals, and the predicament of belief for the church today. Recognizing that the battle over Jesus is no longer a public debate between the skeptic and believer but an internal struggle in the heart of many disciples, he argues that we continue to make christological claims about more than an &#34;event&#34; or simply the &#34;Jesus of history.&#34; On the other hand, C. S. Lewis&#39;s infamous &#34;liar, lunatic, and Lord&#34; scheme is no longer intellectually tenable. This may be a guide to Jesus, but for Christians, Fuller is guiding us toward a deeper understanding of God. He thinks it&#39;s good newsgood news about a God who is so invested in the world that God refuses to be God without us.</p><p>Tripp Fuller is the founder and cohost of <i>Homebrewed Christianity</i>, the top theology podcast in the world.

Kaplan and David P. Norton introduced the Balanced Scorecard, a revolutionary performance measurement system that allowed organizations to quantify intangible assets such as people, information, and customer relationships. Then, in <i>The Strategy-Focused Organization</i>, Kaplan and Norton showed how organizations achieved breakthrough performance with a management system that put the Balanced Scorecard into action.<br><br>Now, using their ongoing research with hundreds of Balanced Scorecard adopters across the globe, the authors have created a powerful new tool--the "strategy map"--that enables companies to describe the links between intangible assets and value creation with a clarity and precision never before possible. Kaplan and Norton argue that the most critical aspect of strategy--implementing it in a way that ensures sustained value creation--depends on managing four key internal processes: operations, customer relationships, innovation, and regulatory and social processes. The authors show how companies can use strategy maps to link those processes to desired outcomes; evaluate, measure, and improve the processes most critical to success; and target investments in human, informational, and organizational capital. Providing a visual "aha!" for executives everywhere who can't figure out why their strategy isn't working, <i>Strategy Maps</i> is a blueprint any organization can follow to align processes, people, and information technology for superior performance.</p><p>Robert S.

Clawed and clawed, marking territory. This is Beast territory. This is Beast hunting ground. Snarled again. Shook more water out of pelt. Left spoor at ground under tree, on top of male cat scat. This said, Beast place. All who hunted here would know it was Beast place. Went back to pool of water and drank. Beast water. And when Beast sees deer again, Beast deer. Beast food.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beast screamed, mountain lion cry bouncing up hills like human ball on walls. Beast shook, flinging more water, and shoved off with all four feet. Straight-up jump, what Jane would say was too high, but Puma concolor knew was good jump. Landed on top of rock ridge. Raced into trees and down top of hill toward house that was human home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Snow began to fall. Ran through snowflakes, slinky and lithe and lissome. Good words for Beast. Each leap covered more than Beast body and tail, body and tail, and part of body again. Was long run steps.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sun dipped behind western ridge. Dusk fell. Beast eyes saw world as green and silver and gray and many shades of black. Cold air and snow kept Beast cool. Felt good on strong body. But Beast still hungered. Was skinny.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thought of humans and vampires and witches. Want to hunt bison in Edmund car. Edmund is gone. Want to sit on Leo and rub jaw on Leo to scent mark. But Leo is gone. Want to curl around Angie Baby and Little Evan and new kit and keep kits safe. But kits are gone. Beast is hungry. Beast is sad.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thought about big cat spoor. Beast is lonely.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Felt/saw/smelled change. Beast stopped. Crouched. Thought was another deer, but . . . vibration beneath Beast's paws was too big for running deer. Was like stone on stone, not deer hooves. Beast quivered in reaction, sniffing, dropping belly to snow. Thinking. Vibration got stronger. Claws extruded and sank into leaves on ground beneath snow. Vibration got stronger again. Earth moves, Beast thought. Earth is alive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Snow fell from quivering branches overhead. Large globs landed on snow with soft plops. Dollop of snow splatted onto Beast's back. Beast hissed. Leaped high and to side, into trees, hissing, spitting, hissing, growling. Raced up tall tree into branches. Hunched tight. Smelling for enemy. But tree was shaking too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Earth settled. Night fell darker beneath heavy clouds. Faint light came from place where sun set. Beast turned to stare at it. Sun was gone. Was too light there now. Had been darker there when sun set last time Beast hunted. More white man's lights? Hate white man's lights.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When Beast was satisfied that Earth was staying still, Beast dropped from limb, loped toward house. Smelled wood smoke on air. Smelled Brute spoor stink. Smelled Bruiser and Eli and stink of gunfire from new shooting range. Family. Saw snow fall, felt snow landing on coat. Trotted out of tree line, along row of grapevines, branches showing hints of green from warmer weather, now gone again. Bruiser said Mother Nature was fickle. Beast did not understand fickle. Trotted past unfinished cottages. Past finished cottages. Up to house that Jane called inn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beast did not need lights, but security lights were on. Alex and Eli trusted Beast to know if Beast was safe, but did not trust Jane to live, so littermates had come. They had put up cameras. Beast was on camera and motion sensors. Beast thought about spraying spoor on cameras and chuffed with laughter. But Bruiser was here. Eli and Alex. Family. Beast did not spray cameras.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beast was nearing front steps when something in mind tore with harsh sound. Beast stopped. Stumbled. Fell to snow. In head, deep in mind, Edmund screamed, "My mistress! Dange-" The sound of his cry was cut off. Was sound of agony. Beast froze, lying in snow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Edmund cry waked Jane.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beast? Was that Ed?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beast whirled body and spun to feet. Raced for door, sprinting, leaping, covering twenty feet in a bound.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ed? Jane whispered in my/our mind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Edmund screamed. Sound as if heart was being torn out with claws.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oh no. Oh nonononono, Jane thought. He's being . . . He's being tortured.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pain and vertigo and the scent of blood flooded through me. Beast�s paws overlapped and we stumbled, falling hard to our side. Rolled back to our feet. Ed? I screamed for him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There was nothing. A blank dark hole where the connection to Ed used to reside. I hadn't even noticed the bond was there, a real, tangible thing. Nor had I noticed the shield between us until it tore, that horrible ripping sound in Beast's mind. But the absence of the bond, the absence of Ed, was glaring, screaming, like night terrors and drowning and being sucked into a deep, dark hole in an underground river.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I/we staggered, raced up the stairs and inside, through the huge rubber-flapped cat door Eli had installed to the side of the human one. The silver-bell chimes announced our arrival. We raced across the thick Oriental rug of the foyer. Dry heat, artificial light, and the sound of a game on the huge TV screen over the fireplace were like being smacked in the senses, and we skidded on snow-damp paws across the marble flooring as we raced into the noisy office/TV/living area.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beast had hunter eyes on Alex, sitting at the antique two-sided desk that took up the entire far end of the room. We leaped to cross the space, cat eyes seeing what he was working on while in midair. On three of his screens were files and research about the Dark Queen, and on two others were e-mails from witches about methods to treat magically induced cancer. We landed, slipping again on the slick floor, banging into the splayed feet of Alex's desk chair. Sending him rolling.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Kid grunted, pulled himself back into place, and tried to wave us away. Beast reached up and took his hand in her teeth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The game went silent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The room went still. Sweat smell of surprise came from Alex. He slowly turned his head and looked at us, long curls sliding across his dark-skinned forehead and cheek. "Jane?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eli was standing behind us, weapon drawn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They think I died and you went feral, I thought at Beast.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She snorted at that thought and let go of Alex's hand. It tasted of sweat and soot and coffee and an odd chemical under-tang. Beast rose to her back feet, placing her right paw on the desk near the keyboard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Alex said, "Oh." He opened the file drawer to the side and pulled out the specially made, heavy-duty, oversized keyboard, placing it in front of us. Behind us, Eli relaxed and we heard the sound of a weapon click back into the Kydex holster.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beast extruded her claws and turned over the use of the paw to me. Carefully, slowly, I typed. Letter by letter, the words appeared on the small designated screen to Alex's far left. 'ed n trouble. where ed?'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eli grunted in worry, propped a hip on the large oak desk, and pulled out his phone, probably to text Bruiser to get back to the house. My honeybunch was out in the vineyard, checking the youngest vines and the new trellis and the stability of the terraces down the hill from the house. Beast had smelled him on the wind as we raced inside and located him reliably. Bruiser wasn't alone. He was with Brute, the white werewolf, and Pea, the grindylow. Not things I had consciously noted until I needed to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Alex slanted sharp eyes at us and went to work, minimizing two of his screens, searching through private vampire sites he was able to access because of my position in Mithran hierarchy, and other sites that were open to the public. Beast dropped to the floor as he worked and pulled the ceramic water bowl to her with a paw. There were water bowls placed strategically throughout the house, all ceramic, since she refused to drink out of metal bowls, preferring toilet water to the taste of steel. Which had been gack until I was able to explain to the humans what was wrong. She lapped water.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The house had been an inn and vineyard that I bought before I left New Orleans. I'd needed a place to lie low while either my human body died from magically induced cancer or I decided to stay in Beast's form forever. I hadn't known what I was buying, not exactly. I was just hunting for acreage and I bought a property that had gone into foreclosure after the original owners' costly divorce. Now it was territory for Beast and a house big enough for my family and clan to live with me. If I survived.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eli asked. "Did you hear Ed psychically through the binding?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beast stopped drinking and looked up at him. I/we nodded once. Deep inside, my thoughts plundered the empty place where Ed had been, a place that was now raw and bleeding and broken. He had been here, inside of us, all this time, bound to me as his mistress. Now he was gone. I needed to help him. I needed to help him now. And I couldn't.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beast will hunt for Ed, she thought.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ed is far away, I thought back.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You're all wet," Eli said. "What'd you do, fall in the creek?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beast snarled.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eli's face seemed permanently creased with mixed emotions, complex weavings of fury, despair, anger, grief. He seldom laughed these days, and I was the problem. If he could heal me by shooting something, I'd be healthy and happy, because he was going through ammo as if it grew on trees, in the outdoor shooting range he had set up. But he was helpless in the face of a magical disease that no one knew how to treat. A rare moment of amusement lit his face. "You did," Eli said. "You fell in."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beast snarled at him and thought at me, Do not like water. Hate water. Hate cold water. Water helped deer get away. Water stole deer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I let my thoughts riffle through Beast's memory and saw her landing in the icy water, plunging beneath. Inside, I laughed but said nothing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beast is best hunter. Water stole deer, she insisted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Okay, I thought.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I hunger. Want to hunt bison in Edmund car.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There were at least three bison ranches within driving distance of Asheville, and we had this conversation multiple times a week. I figured that this time it was to cheer me up, to put my fear for Edmund to the side, but it was more distraction than comfort. I mentally counted to ten.</p></p><h2>America: The Cookbook</h2><p><p><b>With 800 home-cooking recipes, America: The Cookbook is a celebration of the remarkable diversity of American food and food culture state by state.

There are many reasons for spending time in the remote outdoors. Awe-inspiring scenery, peacefulness, wildlife viewing, and exercise are all good reasons. Another is that such experiences build character: "The wildlands teach us to be smart, practical, resourceful, and observant. To hike ten hours through scabrous terrain, cross a brawny river, stay warm in a snowstorm, and navigate your way out of tangled woods tests and builds your best faculties." While no single book can prepare one for spending time in the wilderness--much less impart all the skills necessary to survive in the elements--the <i>NOLS Guide</i> is an eminently useful place to start. Chapters include primers on equipment (fitting boots and packs, choosing a tent, the "Five Commandments for Equipment Care"); appropriate dress for a variety of climates; and ways of traveling in the backcountry, from crossing scree fields to fording rivers. It's not a substitute for in-depth instruction in, say, snow camping, or reading a map and compass. But with a solid grounding in the basics, one can take that first boot-step into what Joseph Wood Krutch called "the great reservoir of energy, of confidence, of endless hope."The National Outdoor Leadership School conducts outdoor adventure programs at eight branches throughout the world; its headquarters are in the foothills of Wind River Range in Lander, Wyoming.</p><h2>Llamaphones (A Grammar Zoo Book)</h2><p><i>Llamaphones</i>, Janik Coat&#x2019;s much-anticipated follow-up&nbsp;to <i>Hippopposites</i> and <i>Rhymoceros</i>, features witty words that sound the same but are spelled differently&#x2014;and have different meanings.&nbsp;Like the other books in the series, this one features surprising novelties, including a touch-and-feel element, making homophones an easy and fun concept to learn.</p><p><b>Janik Coat</b> is an author, illustrator, and graphic designer.

How can your institution do it and do it well? The Participatory Museum is a practical guide to working with community members and visitors to make cultural institutions more dynamic, relevant, essential places. Museum consultant and exhibit designer Nina Simon weaves together innovative design techniques and case studies to make a powerful case for participatory practice. &#34;Nina Simon&#39;s new book is essential for museum directors interested in experimenting with audience participation on the one hand and cautious about upending the tradition museum model on the other. In concentrating on the practical, this book makes implementation possible in most museums. More importantly, in describing the philosophy and rationale behind participatory activity, it makes clear that action does not always require new technology or machinery. Museums need to change, are changing, and will change further in the future. This book is a helpful and thoughtful road map for speeding such transformation.&#34; -Elaine Heumann Gurian, international museum consultant and author of Civilizing the Museum &#34;This book is an extraordinary resource.

Over 370 of the most common species are accurately described in this handy volume: varieties of timothy, rye, foxtail, fescue, bluegrass, nutrush, cottongrass, bulrush, etc. Knobel's emphasis is upon wild varieties of these plants common to the eastern and central United States, but many cultivated strains and food grains such as rice, oats, and maize are also included.<br>A general key on the first page of this book allows you to fit each plant into one of several basic structural categories. Further subdivisions, classified according to the structure of the ear and spikelet (the flowering part of the plant) identify the particular species. Each plant is then described according to common name, Latin name, height, color of flower and stem, texture, smell (if applicable), habitat, and even edibility. Close resemblances to other varieties are also noted, which helps to make identifications even easier. Each description is also accompanied by a drawing of an entire plant, and a second drawing of the actual spikelet (with scale of the drawing noted). The author includes a total of 28 plates and over 600 line drawings.<br>This new Dover edition has been completely revised, with common and scientific nomenclature updated, by Mildred E.

We brought a bottle of Don Julio tequila, which Leyner sampled voraciously in the cab, insisting that it needed to be screened for industrial toxins. We enter the elegantly appointed Park Avenue home of Eloise Cameron, a philanthropist, patron of the arts, and Botox junkie. Hors d'oeuvres are being served and the slightly inebriated and flush-faced Leyner grabs a mouthful of Swedish meatballs, proceeds to kiss our hostess, and then comments, "Eloise, baby, better lay off the collagen. Kissing those lips is like making out with the Michelin man." She attempts to smirk with disdain, but the Botox leaves her face impassive.<br><br> I corral Leyner and we proceed into the living room. No sooner have we entered when I'm embraced from behind. I turn around and it's Jeremy Burns, an investment banker who sits two rows behind me at the Knicks games. Jeremy is well known to the Madison Square Garden food vendors for his insatiable appetite for hot dogs, cotton candy, and beer. He is now almost unrecognizable in his new Atkins-induced skeletonlike state. "Who exhumed you?" Leyner belches. I am overcome by embarrassment but secretly wetting myself with laughter. Jeremy tries to sidestep Leyner and as their arms brush, Leyner is covered with the grease that now oozes from Jeremy's pores. Leyner whispers to me, "This dude is all greased up like a rectal thermometer." I push Leyner away and he uses this opportunity to sneak over to the bar for another blast of Don Julio. I am left with Jeremy and his insufferable stories about life on the meat and fat diet, and a million medical questions about food.<br><br> If we are what we eat, why do we know so little about food and nutrition?<br><br><i>DOES IT REALLY TAKE SEVEN YEARS TO DIGEST CHEWING GUM?</i><br><br> What is it with seven years? You break a mirror, seven years of bad luck. Each dog year is seven human years. Seven years to digest swallowed gum? What if a dog broke a mirror then swallowed a pack of gum? Sounds like an algebra problem.<br><br> Chewing gum is not digestible but it definitely doesn't sit in your stomach for years. Gum actually might help things move through the bowels faster. Sorbitol is sometimes used as a sweetener in gum and this can act as a laxative. What does this mean? Yes, if you look carefully, you should see it floating next to all of those lovely yellow corn kernels.<br><i>WHY DOES YOUR PEE SMELL WHEN YOU EAT ASPARAGUS?</i><br><br> Asparagus contains a sulfur compound called mercaptan. It is also found in onions, garlic, rotten eggs, and in the secretions of skunks. The signature smell occurs when this substance is broken down in your digestive system. Not all people have the gene for the enzyme that breaks down mercaptan, so some of you can eat all the asparagus you want without stinking up the place. One study published in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology found that only 46 percent of British people tested produced the odor while 100 percent of French people tested did. Insert your favorite French joke here________________________________.<br><i>WHAT CAUSES AN ICE CREAM HEADACHE?</i><br><br> Aaaah, the joy of a Popsicle on a hot summer day.<br><br> One theory places the source for the brain freeze in the sinuses, where the pain may be caused by the rapid cooling of air in the frontal sinuses. This triggers local pain receptors.<br><br> Another theory postulates that the constriction of blood vessels in the roof and rear of the mouth causes pain receptors to overload and refer the pain to your head. There is a nerve center there, in the back of your mouth, called the sphenopalatine ganglion, and this is the most likely source of the dreaded ice cream headache.<br><br> A friend of ours suggested a quick cure of rapidly rubbing your tongue on the roof of your mouth to warm it up. Her demonstration included a bizarre clucking sound. Leyner tried this and found himself followed by a large goose of whom he seems to have become inordinately fond.</p><h2>Why Kings Confess (Sebastian St. Cyr Mystery)</h2><p><b>Regency England, January 1813:</b>&nbsp;The mutilated body of a young French doctor found in an alley beside a mysterious, badly injured woman entangles Sebastian in the deadly riddle of the &#x201c;Lost Dauphin,&#x201d; the boy prince who disappeared during the darkest days of the French Revolution.<br>&nbsp;<br>Thrust into dangerous conflict with the Dauphin&#x2019;s sister&#x2014;the imperious, ruthless daughter of Marie Antoinette&#x2014;Sebastian finds his self-control shattered when he recognizes the injured woman as Alexi Sauvage, a figure from his own past associated with an act of wartime brutality and betrayal that nearly destroyed him.<br>&nbsp;<br>With the murderer striking ever closer, Sebastian fears for the lives of his pregnant wife, Hero, and their soon-to-be-born child.

There were times when he wandered these alleyways lost in brightly hued reveries of opium-induced euphoria. But not tonight. Tonight, Gibson clenched his jaw and tried to focus on the tap-tap of his wooden leg on the icy cobbles, the reedy wail of a babe carried on the night wind&#x2014;anything that might distract his mind from the restless, hungering need that drenched his thin frame with sweat and tormented him with ghosts of what could be.</p><p>When he first noticed the woman, he thought her an apparition, a mirage of gray wool and velvet lying crumpled beside the entrance to a fetid passageway. But as he drew nearer, he saw pale flesh and the gleaming dark wetness of blood and knew she was only too real.</p><p>He drew up sharply, the dank, briny air of the nearby Thames rasping in his throat. Cat&#x2019;s Hole, they called this narrow lane, a refuge for thieves, prostitutes, and all the desperate dispossessed of England and beyond. He could feel his heart pounding; the stars glittered like shards of broken glass in the thin slice of cold black sky visible between the looming rooftops above. He hesitated perhaps longer than he should have. But he was a surgeon, his life dedicated to the care of others.</p><p>He pushed himself forward again.</p><p>She lay curled half on her side, one hand flung out palm up, eyes closed. He hunkered down awkwardly beside her, fingertips searching for a pulse in her slim neck. Her face was delicately boned and framed by a riot of long, flame red hair, her lashes dark and thick against the pale flesh of her smooth cheeks, her lips purple-blue with cold. Or death.</p><p>But at his touch, her eyelids fluttered open, her chest jerking on a sob and a broken, whispered prayer. <i>&#x201c;Sainte Marie, M�re de Dieu,</i> <i>priez pour nous pauvres p�cheurs&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</i></p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right; I&#x2019;m here to help you,&#x201d; he said gently, wondering whether she could even understand him. &#x201c;Where are you hurt?&#x201d;</p><p>The entire side of her head, he now saw, was matted with blood. Wide-eyed and frightened, she fixed her gaze on him. Then her focus shifted to where the black mouth of the passage yawned beside them. &#x201c;Damion&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Her hand jerked up to clutch his sleeve. &#x201c;Is he all right?&#x201d;</p><p>Gibson followed her gaze. The man&#x2019;s body was more difficult to discern, a dark, motionless mass deep in the shadows. Gibson shook his head. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;</p><p>Her grip on his arm twisted convulsively. &#x201c;Go to him. Please.&#x201d;</p><p>Nodding, Gibson surged upright, staggering slightly as his wooden peg took his weight and the phantom pains of a long-gone limb ripped through him.</p><p>The passage reeked of rot and excrement and the familiar coppery stench of spilled blood. The man lay sprawled on his back beside a pile of broken hogsheads and crates. It was with difficulty that Gibson picked out the once snowy white folds of a cravat, the silken sheen of what had been a fine waistcoat but was now a blood-soaked mess, horribly ripped.</p><p>&#x201c;Tell me,&#x201d; said the woman. &#x201c;Tell me he lives.&#x201d;</p><p>But Gibson could only stare at the body before him. The man&#x2019;s eyes were wide and sightless, his handsome young face pallid, his outflung arms stiffening in the cold. Someone had hacked open the corpse&#x2019;s chest with a ruthless savagery that spoke of rage tinged with madness. And where the heart should have been gaped only an open cavity.</p><p>Bloody and empty.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Friday, 22 January</p><p>The dream began as it often did, with the sun shining golden warm and the laughter of children at play floating on an orange blossom&#x2013;scented breeze.</p><p>Sebastian St. Cyr, Viscount Devlin, moved restlessly in his sleep, for he knew only too well what was to come. The thunder of galloping horses. A shouted order. The hiss of sabers drawn with deadly purpose from well-oiled scabbards. He gave a low moan.</p><p>&#x201c;Devlin?&#x201d;</p><p>Laughter turned to screams of terror. His vision filled with slashing hooves and bare steel stained dark with innocent blood.</p><p><i>&#x201c;Devlin.&#x201d;</i></p><p>He opened his eyes, his chest heaving as he sucked in a deep, ragged breath. He felt his wife&#x2019;s gentle fingertips touch his lips. Her face rose above him in the darkness, her features pale in the glow of the fire that still burned warm on the bedroom hearth. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a dream,&#x201d; she whispered, although he saw the worry that drew together her dark brows. &#x201c;Just a dream.&#x201d;</p><p>For a moment he could only stare at her, lost in the past. Then he folded his arms around Hero and drew her close, so that she could no longer see his face. It was a dream, yes. But it was also a memory, one he had never shared with anyone.</p><p>&#x201c;Did I wake you?&#x201d; he asked, his voice a hoarse rasp. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d;</p><p>She shook her head, her weight shifting as she sought in vain for a comfortable position, for she was nearly nine months heavy with his child. &#x201c;Your son keeps kicking me.&#x201d;</p><p>Smiling, he placed his hand on the taut mound of her belly and felt a strong heel grind against his palm. &#x201c;Shockingly ill-mannered of her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think he&#x2019;s beginning to find it a wee bit crowded in there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There is a solution.&#x201d;</p><p>She laughed, a low, husky sound that caught without warning at his heart, then twisted. As much as he yearned to hold this child in his arms, thoughts of the looming birth inevitably brought a sense of disquiet that came perilously close to fear. He&#x2019;d read once that more than one in ten women died in childbirth. Hero&#x2019;s own mother had lost babe after babe&#x2014;before nearly dying herself.</p><p>Yet he heard no echo of his own terror in Hero&#x2019;s calm voice when she said, &#x201c;Not long now.&#x201d;</p><p>He felt the babe kick one last time, then settle as Hero snuggled beside him. He brushed his lips against her temple and murmured, &#x201c;Try to sleep.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You sleep,&#x201d; she said, still smiling.</p><p>He watched her eyelids drift closed, her breathing slow. Yet the tension that thrummed within him remained, and he found himself wondering if it was the coming babe that had sent his unconscious thoughts drifting back to a time he wished so desperately to forget. A cold wind stirred the heavy velvet drapes at the windows and banged an unlatched shutter somewhere in the darkness. There were nights when the high, arid mountains and ancient, stone-walled villages of Spain and Portugal seemed a lifetime away from the London town house sleeping around him. Yet he knew they were not.</p><p>He was still awake when an urgent message arrived in Brook Street from Paul Gibson, asking for Sebastian&#x2019;s help.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>The woman lay in a narrow bed in the front chamber of Gibson&#x2019;s Tower Hill surgery. The room was small and plain and lit only by a single candlestick and the enormous fire that roared on the hearth. Piles of blankets covered her thin frame, yet still she shivered. Between the blankets and the thick bandage that swathed the side of her head, Sebastian could see little of her face. But what he could see looked ominously pale and bloodless.</p><p>&#x201c;Will she live?&#x201d; he asked quietly, pausing in the chamber&#x2019;s doorway.</p><p>Gibson stood beside the bed, his gaze, like Sebastian&#x2019;s, on the unconscious woman before him. &#x201c;Difficult to say at this point. There could be bleeding in the brain. If so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He let his voice trail away.</p><p>Sebastian shifted his gaze to his friend&#x2019;s gaunt face. He was looking unusually haggard, even for Gibson, his cheeks hollow and unshaven, his green eyes sunken and bloodshot, his wiry frame close to emaciated. He was only in his early thirties, yet streaks of gray already showed at the temples of his dark hair.</p><p>The two men came from different worlds, one the son of a poor Irish Catholic, the other heir to the powerful Earl of Hendon. But they were old friends. Once, they&#x2019;d both worn the King&#x2019;s colors, fighting from the mountains of Italy to the fever-racked swamps of the West Indies and the stony uplands of Iberia. As a regimental surgeon, Gibson had learned the secrets of life and death with an intimate familiarity rarely matched by his civilian peers. When a French cannonball tore off the lower part of one of his legs and left him bedeviled by chronic pain, he had come here, to London, to share his knowledge of anatomy at the teaching hospitals of St. Thomas&#x2019;s and St. Bartholomew&#x2019;s, and to open this small surgery in the shadow of the Tower of London.</p><p>&#x201c;And if there is bleeding in the brain?&#x201d; Sebastian asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Then she&#x2019;ll die.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How can you know?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Only time will tell. And then there&#x2019;s the risk of pneumonia&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Gibson shook his head. &#x201c;Her body temperature was dangerously low when I found her. I&#x2019;ve packed flannel-wrapped hot bricks around her, but there&#x2019;s not much else I can do at this point.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What was she able to tell you about the attack?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing, I&#x2019;m afraid. She lost consciousness when she learned of her companion&#x2019;s death, and she&#x2019;s yet to come around again. I don&#x2019;t even know her name.&#x201d;</p><p>Sebastian glanced at the bloodstained gray wool walking dress and velvet-trimmed spencer tossed over a nearby chair back. Both were worn but, other than for the new stains, clean and respectable. This was no common woman of the streets.</p><p>&#x201c;And the dead man? What do you know of him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a French physician named Dr. Damion Pelletan.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A Frenchman?&#x201d;</p><p>Gibson nodded. &#x201c;According to his papers, he registered as an alien just three weeks ago.&#x201d; He raked his disheveled hair back from his face with splayed fingers. &#x201c;The fools who pass for the authorities in St. Katharine&#x2019;s are convinced the attack was the work of footpads.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;St. Katharine&#x2019;s is a dangerous place,&#x201d; said Sebastian. &#x201c;Especially at night. What the devil were you doing there?&#x201d;</p><p>Gibson&#x2019;s gaze drifted away. &#x201c;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I sometimes feel the need to walk, of an evening.&#x201d;</p><p>Sebastian studied his friend&#x2019;s flushed, half-averted face and wondered what the hell would drive a one-legged Irish surgeon to wander the back alleys of St. Katharine&#x2019;s on one of the coldest nights of the year. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re lucky you didn&#x2019;t fall victim to these footpads yourselves.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Footpads had nothing to do with this.&#x201d;</p><p>Sebastian raised one eyebrow. &#x201c;So certain?&#x201d;</p><p>Gibson nodded to the middle-aged matron who dozed in a slat-backed wooden chair beside the fire. &#x201c;Keep an eye on the woman,&#x201d; he told her. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t be long.&#x201d;</p><p>To Sebastian, he said, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s something I want you to see.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>At the base of the frost-browned, unkempt yard that stretched to the rear of the surgery stood a low stone outbuilding where Gibson conducted both his official postmortems and the surreptitious, illegal dissections he performed on cadavers filched from the city&#x2019;s churchyards by body snatchers. Of one room only, with high windows to discourage the curious, the building had a flagged floor and was bitterly cold. At its center stood a granite slab with strategically placed drains and a channel cut into the outer edge.</p><p>The body of a man, still fully clothed, lay upon it.</p><p>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t had a chance to begin with him yet,&#x201d; said Gibson, hooking the lantern he carried onto the chain that dangled over the slab.</p><p>It sometimes seemed to Sebastian as if every suicide, every bloated body pulled from the Thames, every decaying cadaver that passed through this building, had left a stench that seeped into its walls, their muted howls of anguish and despair echoing still.</p><p>He took a deep breath and entered the room. &#x201c;If St. Katharine&#x2019;s authorities are convinced he was killed by common thieves, I&#x2019;m surprised they agreed to an autopsy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They weren&#x2019;t exactly what you might call enthusiastic. To quote Constable O&#x2019;Keefe&#x201d;&#x2014;Gibson puffed out his cheeks, narrowed his eyes, and adopted a decidedly nasal accent&#x2014;&#x201c;&#x2018;Wot ye want t&#x2019; be botherin&#x2019; wit&#x2019; all that fer, then? Sure but any fool can see wot killed him.&#x2019;&#x201d;<i> </i>The lantern swung back and forth on its chain, casting macabre shadows across the slab and its grisly occupant. He put up a hand to still it. &#x201c;I had to promise I wouldn&#x2019;t be charging the parish for my services. And I paid the lads who carried the body here myself.&#x201d;</p><p>Sebastian studied the slim, slightly built man upon the surgeon&#x2019;s slab. He was young yet, probably no more than twenty-six or twenty-eight, with a pleasant, even-featured face and high forehead framed by soft golden curls. His clothes were of good quality&#x2014;better than the woman&#x2019;s and considerably newer, fashionably cut in the Parisian style and showing little wear. But what had once been a fine silk waistcoat and linen shirt were now ripped and soaked with blood, the chest beneath hacked open to reveal a gaping cavity.</p><p>&#x201c;What the hell? He looks like he was attacked with an axe.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s worse than that,&#x201d; said Gibson, tucking his hands up under his armpits for warmth. &#x201c;His heart has been removed.&#x201d;</p><p>Sebastian raised his gaze to the Irishman&#x2019;s solemn face. &#x201c;Please tell me he was already dead when this was done to him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I honestly don&#x2019;t know yet.&#x201d;</p><p>Sebastian forced himself to look, again, at that ravaged torso. &#x201c;Any chance this could be the work of a student of medicine?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you serious? Even a butcher would have been more delicate. Whoever did this made a right royal mess of it.&#x201d;</p><p>Sebastian shifted his gaze to the dead man&#x2019;s face. His eyes were large and widely spaced, the nose prominent, the mouth full lipped and soft, almost feminine. Even in death, there was a gentleness and kindness to his features that made what had been done to him seem somehow that much more horrible.</p><p>&#x201c;You say he was a physician?&#x201d;</p><p>Gibson nodded. &#x201c;He was staying at the Gifford Arms, in York Street. The constables brought round a gentleman from the hotel&#x2014;a Monsieur Vaundreuil&#x2014;to identify him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yet he couldn&#x2019;t identify the woman?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Said he&#x2019;d never seen her before. He also said he&#x2019;d no notion what Pelletan might have been doing in St. Katharine&#x2019;s.&#x201d; Gibson rubbed the back of his neck. &#x201c;I should mention that, along with his papers, the constables also found a purse containing both banknotes and silver.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yet they&#x2019;re convinced he fell victim to footpads?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The theory is that the thieves were interrupted.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;By you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I certainly didn&#x2019;t see anyone. But then&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But then&#x2014;what?&#x201d; asked Sebastian.</p><p>Gibson colored. &#x201c;I was rather lost in my own thoughts.&#x201d;</p><p>Sebastian watched his friend look pointedly away but remained silent.</p><p>Gibson said, &#x201c;If he were English, the circumstances might be strange enough to prod even St. Katharine&#x2019;s authorities into taking action. But he&#x2019;s not; he&#x2019;s a Frenchman&#x2014;a stranger&#x2014;which makes it all too easy to simply dismiss the murder as the work of footpads and forget it.&#x201d;</p><p>Sebastian lowered his gaze to the pallid corpse on the slab between them. For some reason he could not have named, he knew a faint, unsettling echo of that night&#x2019;s troubled dream and all the unwanted memories it had provoked. For two years now he had dedicated himself to achieving a measure of justice for murder victims who would otherwise be forgotten. And it occurred to him, not for the first time, that those far...</p></p><h2>A Desperate Fortune</h2><p><p><strong>A <em>New York Times</em> Bestseller!</strong></p><p>"I've loved every one of Susanna's books!

She knew me well enough to know I wouldn't try to catch it, either.</p> <p>"Come keep me company," she said, and drew me firmly to one side of all the colorful commotion. "I need to sit."</p> <p>My father's wild Aunt Lucy, nearly lost in layered flounces of bronze taffeta, tried once to herd us back as we went past. "Oh, girls, you mustn't run away. Go on, get in there. Have a go." Smiling at my cousin, she said, "Third time lucky, Jacqueline, so they say. And Sara, dear," she added in a cheering tone, to me, "there's always hope."</p> <p>I might have pointed out there wasn't, really. Catching things had never been my strong suit, and it always seemed ridiculous to go through all that effort just to field a bunch of flowers that, while pretty, only showed which of the women at the wedding was the most determined to be married next, not which one would be.</p> <p>Jacqui didn't give me time to point out anything. She simply answered, "Yes, Aunt Lucy, thanks for that, but Sara isn't feeling well."</p> <p>And then she steered me off again.</p> <p>I looked at her. "I'm feeling fine."</p> <p>"I had to give her some excuse, or she'd have never let us be. You know the way she is. And I could hardly say I wasn't feeling well-she'd only think that I was pregnant."</p> <p>I had to admit that was true. Jacqui's love life-including her two short-lived marriages, one to a singer flamboyant enough to ensure their divorce had been given a place in the tabloids-was frequently a source of gossip at these family gatherings. She fueled that gossip on her own sometimes when she got bored, and had been known to start a rumor in one corner of the room to see how long it took to travel to another, but this evening she did not seem bored.</p> <p>I asked, because I couldn't see the man she'd come with, "Where did you leave Humphrey?"</p> <p>"Over there. He found the punch bowl, I'm afraid, before I had a chance to warn him. Drank three glasses of it."</p> <p>Uncle Gordon spiked the punch at every family wedding. No one knew with what, but even those of us who'd only ever heard about the hangovers knew better than to drink the stuff. "Poor Humphrey."</p> <p>Jacqui sighed. "Poor me, more like. I doubt he'll make it into work on Monday, and we've got a sales meeting. That's what I get," she said, "for bringing my assistant to a Thomas family wedding."</p> <p>I agreed she should have known better. I hadn't brought a date myself, but then I didn't have a Humphrey, clever and good-looking, sitting handily outside my office door. And no one here expected me to bring somebody, anyway.</p> <p>"Let's find a table," Jacqui said.</p> <p>We found one tucked quietly off in a corner, half-hidden by one of the faux-marble columns that held up the wedding hall's high ceiling, painted ethereal blue with winged cherubs. The whole setting was a bit over-the-top, but it suited our young cousin Daphne, whose wedding this was. Daphne lived and breathed drama, which made her quite fun in small doses but very exhausting in larger ones.</p> <p>"All a bit much?" Jacqui asked me. At first I assumed she was thinking, as I was, about the wedding, but then she asked, "How are you coping?" and I understood.</p> <p>She had always been something of my guardian angel, since I'd been put into her arms as a baby when she had been ten. She was, if one worked out the family tree, more properly my father's cousin, daughter of his youngest uncle, but that made her still my own first cousin once removed, and I had claimed her and was keeping her.</p> <p>It had been Jacqui who'd first noticed something was a little different in the way I saw the world, and through my childhood and my teens she'd been close by to show me what to do, like an interpreter to guide me through the labyrinth; to pick me up and dust me off if I stepped off the path and took a tumble. And the first year I had spent at university, that awful year when things had started coming all unglued for me, it had been Jacqui who had taken me to lunch with a new author, whose first book she had been editing.</p> <p>"He's a psychologist," she'd introduced him. "Brilliant book, just fascinating. All about these children who have-how do you pronounce it, Colin?"</p> <p>"Asperger's." He'd said it with a hard g, as in hamburgers.</p> <p>At Jacqui's prompting, he had talked all through our lunch about the syndrome that at that time was believed to lie midway along the sliding scale between the "normal" world and full-on autism, making those who had it all too miserably aware that they were different without understanding why, unable to read and interpret all the complex social cues most other people took for granted-tones of voice, and body language, and the strange figures of speech that made a person say that he had been "knocked sideways" when he hadn't moved at all.</p> <p>And I had known.</p> <p>It had, if I was honest, been a great relief to finally put a name to what the issue was. I'd gone for consultations later with that same psychologist, and with my cousin waiting just outside his office door, we'd done the proper tests. He had explained it very clearly, using terms I could relate to.</p> <p>"You're a programmer, aren't you?" he'd asked me. "You work with computers. Well, if you think of your own mind as a computer, which it is, then your basic architecture is different from most of the other computers around you. You're wired differently, you connect differently, and you run different software on a different operating system. You're like the lone Mac," he'd concluded, "in an office of PCs. They're all running Windows, and you're running OS X."</p> <p>That had helped. I'd been able to picture that one Mac computer alone on its desk with its own software, processing everything in its own way while all of the other computers, the PCs, shared their incompatible system.</p> <p>But Jacqui hadn't liked that image. "You don't want to be alone, off in your own corner," she had told me in decided tones. And having helped me put a name to what the problem was, she'd tackled it the way she tackled everything: head on. She'd bought me books and studied on her own, and with a single-minded focus Henry Higgins might have envied, she had tutored me in how to hide the signs, to pass for normal.</p> <p>"You just have to pretend," she'd said, choosing another analogy, "that you're an alien, come here to learn about earthlings. Our language, our customs, our idioms, all of that. Study and learn them, the way you would any strange culture. But you don't want to look like an alien, and that means learning to mimic. I'll show you."</p> <p>She'd shown me. Most days, I still felt like an alien, if I was honest. But Jacqui had done her job so well these past several years that my own parents, even when faced with the facts, still refused to believe I was anything more than a little bit quirky. And in a family like mine, I thought-bringing my mind firmly back to the present as new bursts of clapping amid shrieks of laughter announced that somebody had caught the bouquet-being quirky was hardly unusual.</p> <p>"How are you coping?" asked Jacqui again, and I shrugged.</p> <p>"I'm all right. I could have done without the DJ."</p> <p>"Yes, well, so could we all. It was too loud for me," she admitted, "so I can only imagine what it must have been like for you."</p> <p>My senses were...sensitive. Easily jangled and jarred. The wiring of my mind made sounds that other people could ignore strike at me with the full force of a whining dentist's drill. Strong lighting sometimes gave me headaches, certain fabrics rubbed as painfully as sandpaper against my skin, and when all that was added to a room packed full of people, interacting in a way I had to work to understand, then staying calm became a test of my endurance.</p> <p>Jacqui smiled and took a piece of paper from her handbag. "Here," she said, and slid the paper over to me. "This might help."</p> <p>Shaking my head, I assured her, "I'm not at that stage yet."</p> <p>"What stage?"</p> <p>"The Sudoku stage." Then, because she was still watching me with that expression I'd known from my childhood, I added more firmly, "I'm fine."</p> <p>I admittedly found it a little endearing that she'd always fed my addiction to numbers, in full understanding that, when I felt overwhelmed, nothing could calm me like complex equations or, lately, Sudoku-the neat, tidy patterns of numbers in squares, like a warm, fuzzy blanket that wrapped round my mind and was instantly soothing.</p> <p>It hadn't surprised me that Jacqui had noticed when I'd made the switch to Sudoku. There wasn't much Jacqui missed noticing. And for the past several months she had seemed to have one of the puzzles conveniently tucked in her handbag whenever I'd needed one. But...</p> <p>"You can stop looking after me," I told her. "Honestly. I'm a big girl now."</p> <p>"I know that." Her tone told me nothing, but I'd learned that whenever her mouth tightened down at the corners like that, she was being defensive. "And anyway, that's not a puzzle, exactly."</p> <p>I looked at the page. She was right. These were numbers, but not in an order I recognized-just numbers printed in pairs and threes, with dots between them:</p> <p>106.62.181.189.68.172.766.86.128.185.64.175.<br> 19.67.164.186.65.47.679.55.173.25.122.13.64.<br> 562.215.128.196.29.56.63</p> <p>I was already starting to look for the patterns when I asked, "What's this?"</p> <p>"It's a code. Codes were one of your things, weren't they?"</p> <p>"When I was ten, sure." I'd been in Year Six then. Our studies had taken us through World War II and the work of the code breakers at Bletchley Park, and I'd been so obsessed with cryptanalysis that, for the whole remainder of that winter, I had written all my school notes in a cipher of my own devising, much to the frustration of my teachers and my parents. "But that was almost twenty years ago."</p> <p>"Well, I'll lay odds you've not forgotten. That code," she said, with a nod towards the paper I was holding, "is an old one, from the early eighteenth century."</p> <p>It wasn't actually a code, I could have told her, but a cipher. More specifically, it seemed to be a substitution cipher, in which numbers had been used in place of letters of the alphabet. But I only asked, "And why do you have it?"</p> <p>"I got it from one of my authors. You've never met Alistair Scott, have you?"</p> <p>"Who?"</p> <p>"The historian, Alistair Scott. He's quite famous. He used to be on television all the time."</p> <p>I took her word for it. I didn't have a television. "And?" I smoothed the paper with my fingers as I focused on the numbers. There weren't many that were higher than 500, so I guessed those might be placeholders, to mark the ends of words.</p> <p>"He's working on a new book," she went on, "and there's a source he needs to use, but it's in code. He wants someone to break it for him. So I thought of you."</p> <p>"I'm hardly a professional."</p> <p>"You need the work."</p> <p>I paused, and faintly smiled. "I wondered how long it would take before you brought that up. Who told you?"</p> <p>"Need you ask?"</p> <p>My mother, then. I looked more closely at the numbers, noting the most common ones were in the 60s. Probably the e's, I thought. The letter used most frequently in English, after all, was e. It also was the letter we used most for ending words. If I was right about the placeholders, then two words in this cipher ended in 60-somethings, so again, they were most likely e's. I took a pencil from my handbag. "So she's told you all the details, has she?"</p> <p>"Only that you handed in your notice," Jacqui said. "You can't keep doing that."</p> <p>"They wouldn't let me work alone."</p> <p>"Most people in IT do work in teams."</p> <p>"I don't." And if the 60-somethings were all e's, that meant it was the 6 alone that mattered, and the final digit didn't count. Testing this, I tried removing all the final digits right across the board, from all the numbers, and put e's where all the sixes were, and spaces for the placeholders. I ended up with:</p> <p>10.e.18.18.e.17.space.8.12.18.e.17.1.e.16.18.e.4.<br> space.5.17.2.12.1.e.space.21.12.19.2.5.e</p> <p>There, I thought. Much less unwieldy. Right then. Twenty-six letters in the alphabet. Except if I were dealing with a simple substitution cipher, in which a was 1, and b was 2, and so on, then e would be written as 5 and not 6. I flipped e and f round, and got gibberish: Jerreq hlreqaepred fqblae ulsbfe.</p> <p>Jacqui told me, "It would mean a trip to Paris. You like Paris."</p> <p>"In December?"</p> <p>"Well, you wouldn't have to go till after Christmas."</p> <p>"Even worse."</p> <p>She held her silence for a moment, then she said, "You're right. You'd do much better staying here and moving back in with your parents. That would be a lot more fun."</p> <p>I wasn't always good at detecting sarcasm, but in this instance just the words alone were all I needed to be certain she was teasing. Glancing up, I tried to straighten out my smile. "Ha-ha."</p> <p>"No, really. And your mother could invite young men to lunch on Sundays. You could have a lovely time."</p> <p>"I won't need to move home," I said. "I've got three months left on my lease. I'll find another job."</p> <p>"This one would let you work alone. Besides, he pays obscenely well, you know, does Alistair."</p> <p>I shook my head. "I couldn't take his money." I flipped a few more letters, moving closer to an understanding of the patterns used by whoever had made this cipher. "This," I said, "is really pretty basic, not so difficult. I've nearly got it. When I've finished here, I'll let you have the key, and you can pass it on to him, and he can do all the deciphering himself, for nothing."</p> <p>"Yes, well, there's one problem with your logic," Jacqui told me.</p> <p>"What's that?"</p> <p>"The code you've got there," she informed me, "is not the one Alistair needs to have broken."</p> <p>My pencil paused, but only briefly, because I was too far along to just stop. "Then why do I have it?"</p> <p>"It's sort of a test. I told Alistair you were a wizard with codes and things, and he said if you cracked this one in under a week, he would not only hire you, he'd buy you a bottle of whisky."</p> <p>I wasn't sure what letter had been flipped with r. The first word, with its double r, was likely my best clue. It might be meant to be a double l, perhaps, or double t. Since t was the most common English consonant, I went with that. Jetteq, read the first word now, unhelpfully. "He knows what this says, then?"</p> <p>She nodded. "It's out of an old book, or something."</p> <p>I had only two bits of the cipher left to unravel.</p> <p>"Tell Alistair Scott," I said, "that if he's buying me whisky, my preference is sixteen-year-old Lagavulin." I jotted the translation down and rotated the paper to slide it back over the table towards her.</p> <p>I knew that I'd done it correctly when I saw her smile. That was how Jacqui always smiled when I did something to make her proud. "See? I was sure you could do it."</p> <p>"I'm not a real code breaker."</p> <p>"Sara." She held up the paper. "You solved this in seventeen minutes. You're good at it."</p> <p>Probably not good enough, said my inner perfectionist.</p> <p>Jacqui, who'd known me so long and so well that she likely could hear that voice, too, said, "Come with me tomorrow, I'll take you to meet him."</p> <p>"To Paris? Be serious."</p> <p>"Alistair Scott's not in Paris."</p> <p>"But you said-"</p> <p>"He only lives over the river, in Ham. It's the job that's in Paris."</p> <p>She asked me again to come meet him, and of course I told her yes, because I knew she wouldn't let it go until I gave the answer that she wanted. But my gaze stayed on the paper in her hand while we were talking, and I wondered who had written...</p></p><h2>Digging Up the Dirt (A Southern Ladies Mystery)</h2><p><b>The <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Cat in the Stacks mysteries&nbsp;is back with more of those sleuthing Southern belles, the Ducote sisters...</b><br><br>An&#x2019;gel and Dickce Ducote, busy with plans for the Athena Garden Club&#x2019;s spring tour of grand old homes, are having trouble getting the other club members to help. The rest of the group is all a-flutter now that dashing and still-eligible Hadley Partridge is back to restore his family mansion. But the idle chatter soon turns deadly serious when a body turns up on the Partridge estate after a storm...<br> &nbsp;<br> The remains might belong to Hadley&#x2019;s long-lost sister-in-law, Callie, who everyone thought ran off with Hadley years ago.

Now An&#x2019;gel and Dickce will need to get their hands dirty if they hope to reveal a killer&#x2019;s deep-buried motives before someone else&#x2019;s name is mud...</p><p><b>Miranda James</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Cat in the Stacks Mysteries and the Southern Ladies Mysteries.Chapter 1<br><br>Miss Dickce Ducote wanted a clear view of her sister An'gel's face when she broke the news. She wished there were a discreet way she could set up the video camera on her cell phone to record the moment. Then she could threaten to show it to the rest of the Athena Garden Club to annoy her sister. An'gel needed to be wound up occasionally, Dickce thought. Older sisters could get to be a little too stuffy otherwise.<br><br>Miss An'gel Ducote looked up from where she knelt at the edge of the flower bed, trowel in one gloved hand, while the other hand brushed back a stray lock of gray hair. She grimaced. "What is it, Sister? You've obviously got something to tell me. You're practically bouncing on the ground."<br><br>Dickce gave her a sweet smile. "I've been talking to Arliss McGonigal, and you'll never guess what she told me." She paused to make sure she had her sister's complete attention.<br><br>"If you don't get on with it," An'gel said, "I'm going back to work on this bed." She brandished the trowel. "I have four more azaleas to plant here."<br><br>"Hadley Partridge is back in town." Dickce watched her sister's face with avid interest.<br><br>"That's not much of a surprise," An'gel replied, her tone cool and her expression unchanged. "Hamish died three weeks ago, and he had no other family besides his baby brother. Hadley's probably here to oversee the sale of Ashton Hall."<br><br>Dickce had felt sure that news of an old beau's return would rattle her sister at least a tiny bit, but An'gel remained as infuriatingly unflappable as ever.<br><br>"That's where you're wrong." Dickce had another round of ammunition to use. "Word is, Hadley has come home to Athena for good. He's going to restore Ashton Hall and the gardens. In fact, he's planning to be at the garden club board meeting this very afternoon."<br><br>Whatever reply An'gel might have made to that news went unsaid, though Dickce did have the satisfaction of seeing a brief smile from her sister.<br><br>A reddish-brown streak on four legs zipped through the space between the sisters. Hot on the cat Endora's trail came Peanut the Labradoodle. Endora came to a sudden halt about six feet away from where An'gel knelt, turned, and hissed at the dog. Peanut skidded to a stop an inch out of reach of Endora's swinging paw. Cat and dog stared at each other a moment, then Endora was off again with Peanut right behind.<br><br>"They've already been around the house at least four times." An'gel shook her head. "Where they find the energy, I have no idea."<br><br>"They're children, comparatively speaking." Dickce laughed. "Not old women like us." On a beautiful day like this, however, Dickce felt younger than her eighty years. An'gel, four years older, made as few concessions to the passage of time as possible, Dickce knew. That included ignoring overt references to her age.<br><br>An'gel turned back to the azalea she was about to transplant. "Hadley will be welcome at the garden club. Forty years ago he was one of our most active members."<br><br>"And the only man." Dickce chuckled. "I bet he'll be surprised to see his old harem gather around him."<br><br>An'gel snorted. "What a silly word. Harem. You have a salacious mind sometimes, Sister."<br><br>Nettled slightly by An'gel's tone, Dickce snapped back. "Forty years ago you had one, too, Sister. I seem to recall you were pretty interested in Hadley yourself back then, despite the age difference."<br><br>An'gel's shoulders stiffened for a moment. She turned to glare up at Dickce. "Your imagination always did run wild. I seem to recall that you were the one who used to hang on Hadley's every word." She sniffed and turned back to her azalea. "Besides, you're older than he is, too."<br><br>"Only by five years," Dickce retorted. Then she couldn't help herself. She started laughing. She and An'gel sounded like teenagers squabbling over a boy.<br><br>An'gel continued to glare for a moment, then she, too, began to laugh.<br><br>When the merriment ceased, Dickce said, "Hadley was always too darn gorgeous for his own good."<br><br>"And everyone else's," An'gel said in a wry tone. "He's about seventy-five now, and he's probably lost all his looks. He liked the high life too much even then. Bound to be well past his glory days."<br><br>"Well, I guess we'll find out this afternoon." Dickce turned to head into the house but had to pause to let Endora and Peanut whiz by again. "Surely they'll get tired of that before long. See you at lunch, Sister." She walked away, and An'gel finished moving the azalea to its new home.<br><br>Dickce hit the brakes, and the Lexus skidded into a spot between a newish-looking BMW and a ragged-looking, elderly Jaguar. Dickce put the car in park and shut off the engine with a sly smile at her sister.<br><br>Q<br><br>"Your driving is getting worse." An'gel unbuckled her seat belt, her hand a bit shaky.<br><br>"You said you didn't want to be late," Dickce retorted. She pointed to the digital clock on the dash. "We're actually ten minutes early."<br><br>"The way you drove, we could have been extremely late," An'gel said as she stepped out of the car. "As in dead."<br><br>Dickce ignored that little sally. "I don't recognize the BMW. Do you suppose that's Hadley's car?"<br><br>"Either that, or Reba's bought Martin a new car." An'gel shook her head. "The way she spends money on her son, they must be printing it in the attic."<br><br>"Maybe Martin has a job we don't know about." Dickce grinned as she followed An'gel up the brick walk to the two-story colonial-style house that belonged to Barbie Gross, current president of the Athena Garden Club.<br><br>"If he has, it will be the first one in twenty years." An'gel stepped onto the small porch and rang the bell. "He seems allergic to work."<br><br>The door opened, and Barbie Gross nodded in greeting. Barbie, her hair as black as it was the day she had her first dye job at forty, exhibited her trim figure in a black Chanel pantsuit with a sleeveless top. Her tanned, firm arms had resulted from hours of gardening and lifting weights, Dickce knew. It didn't hurt, either, that Barbie was nearly twenty years younger than An'gel.<br><br>"Come on in, girls." She grinned. "Dickce must have driven, because you look a little shell shocked, An'gel."<br><br>"I always think she'll slow down a bit." An'gel grimaced. "I live in foolish hope, obviously."<br><br>Dickce paid no attention to them. "We saw Sarinda's car. Who's in the new BMW?"<br><br>"Arliss," Barbie said. "She picked up Lottie." She led the way into her spacious living room, where two women, one blond, the other a redhead, appeared absorbed in conversation.<br><br>". . . lay odds on who gets Hadley into her bedroom first." The redheaded woman snickered, and the blonde, evidently having noticed the new arrivals, poked her companion and shook her head slightly.<br><br>"Hello, Arliss." Dickce nodded at the redhead, and An'gel echoed her. Then they greeted the blond woman, Lottie MacLeod.<br><br>Dickce examined the two quickly. Arliss McGonigal had chosen a simple shirtwaist in polka-dotted blue silk. Her flame-red hair owed more to a bottle of henna than to nature, and strategic nips and tucks from a surgeon kept her looking at least a decade younger than her seventy-five years. Lottie MacLeod wore her blond ringlets short, and they framed a face with a pert nose, a generous mouth, and eyes that seldom missed anything. Lottie favored Chanel like her best friend, Barbie, but Lottie's shorter, plumper figure appeared better in a pencil skirt rather than a pantsuit. Dickce thought the pale blue dress flattered Lottie's coloring nicely.<br><br>"Where's Sarinda?" An'gel set her handbag on a table that stood in front of the wide picture window. Dickce did the same, and the sisters seated themselves in chairs that faced the sofa occupied by Arliss and Lottie.<br><br>"Touching up her makeup," Arliss said. "With Hadley Partridge due here any minute she's determined to look as flawless as possible."<br><br>"You seem to have spent a good deal of time on your own." Barbie laughed, and Dickce thought the sound seemed tinged with malice.<br><br>Arliss tossed her head. "I require very little makeup. Unlike some women who put it on with a trowel." She glared at Barbie.<br><br>The claws are coming out sooner than usual. Dickce suppressed a giggle. Garden club board meetings always entertained her, and this one promised to be a corker. She wished Hadley would hurry up and get here.<br><br>Barbie regarded Arliss with a cool gaze. "You must give me the name of your plastic surgeon, dear. He seems to have worked absolute miracles for you."<br><br>Lottie chuckled, but quickly covered her mouth with one hand. Her gaze darted back and forth between her best friend and the manifestly peeved redhead.<br><br>"Can't you two rehearse a new scene once in a while?" An'gel glanced sharply at the two combatants.<br><br>Dickce looked toward the door to see Sarinda Hetherington, her ruby-red dress cut low to show off her ample cleavage, enter the room. Sarinda had her long blond hair piled high in order to show off her elegant neck, the product of a top-notch plastic surgeon in Jackson. She, unlike Arliss, never hid the fact she'd had work done.<br><br>"Who's rehearsing?" Sarinda asked.<br><br>"Arliss and Barbie, who else," Dickce said with some asperity. "That's a gorgeous dress, Sarinda. Did you find it on your last trip to New York?"<br><br>"Thank you, Dickce." Sarinda ran her hands down the skirt. "Yes, I did. I found a wonderful new designer. Remind me later, and I'll give you her name." She eyed Dickce for a moment before she chose a chair nearby. "She can work wonders for small bosoms."<br><br>Dickce didn't bat an eyelash before she responded. "I see she works wonders with thick waists as well."<br><br>Both Arliss and Lottie chuckled at that remark, and An'gel shot her sister a quelling look. Dickce resisted the temptation to stick out her tongue at An'gel.<br><br>"I let myself in," a voice announced from the doorway. Everyone turned to greet the latest arrival.<br><br>Reba Dalrymple, Dickce noted with waspish amusement, had worn a short skirt today, the better to show off her long, beautiful legs. How a woman of nearly eighty managed to keep her legs looking like that was a secret Reba never shared. Dickce wasn't in the least surprised to see the short skirt. Reba was obviously determined that Hadley Partridge would have a good look at her two best assets.<br><br>Reba approached the sofa and seated herself between Arliss and Lottie. "Isn't Hadley here yet?" She glanced around the room.<br><br>"He ought to be here any minute," Barbie replied. "As I recall, he was always punctual."<br><br>"Yes, he was," Arliss said. Lottie and Sarinda echoed her. Then they all glared at one another.<br><br>Dickce had to suppress another urge to giggle. She hadn't been far wrong earlier when she referred to Hadley's harem. They were all-including An'gel and herself-excited to see Hadley again. If he turned up bald and overweight, they would all probably faint from the shock.<br><br>The doorbell rang, and Dickce noticed that all heads turned immediately toward the doorway. Barbie hurried from the room. Dickce could hear the voices of Barbie and the latest arrival, and the newcomer sounded like a man. She could hardly bear the suspense while they waited for Barbie to bring Hadley-surely it was Hadley-into the room. She closed her eyes for a moment, and when she opened them, there he stood.<br><br>Chapter 2<br><br>An'gel felt her heart flutter the tiniest bit at the sight of Hadley Partridge. Dickce had teased her earlier in the day about her attraction to Hadley, and she had tried to shrug it off as coolly as possible. She had to admit to herself, however, that she was eager to see the most handsome man she had ever known. He'd always had too roving an eye for An'gel to take him completely seriously when he flirted with her. According to the Athena rumor mill he'd had affairs with any number of women, some of them in this room. The moment she'd heard about his return, however, she began to speculate what he would look like after forty years, whether the old easy, notorious charm would have remained intact. Or whether he had come back to Athena a broken-down wreck of a man, after decades of dissipated living.<br><br>The flutter moved down to her stomach as she stared at Hadley, who had paused in the doorway to observe the room. An'gel noted that the hair once jet-black had turned completely white, but the mane appeared as thick as ever. Hadley had never worn his hair to fit any fashion, and now the flowing locks brushed his neckline. He had obviously spent many years in the sun, and the tanned skin contrasted nicely with the hair. He wore black pants and a densely knitted, dark blue sweater that complemented his dark eyes and white hair perfectly. His slow, seductive smile emerged as he beheld the women who had waited so tensely for his arrival.<br><br>Hadley strode into the room, arms open wide. Barbie, her gaze firmly fixed on Hadley's back, stumbled in behind him and almost knocked over a table. She caught herself and the table in time, but barely, An'gel noted with amusement.<br><br>"Good afternoon, dear ladies." Hadley stopped about three feet away from the assembled group and treated them all to another expansive smile. His hands dropped to his sides. "You don't know how wonderful it is to be home again. And to be greeted by friends who by some miracle are just as gorgeous as they were the day I left Athena those many years ago."<br><br>An'gel heard several sighs, including one from her sister. She might even have sighed herself, but she would never admit it to anyone.<br><br>"Oh, Hadley, it's wonderful that you're back home." Sarinda propelled herself up from the sofa to leap into Hadley's arms. Evidently startled by the sudden movement, Hadley took a step back. Sarinda stumbled, and Hadley reached out to halt her fall. She ended up in his arms, her intention all along. An'gel suppressed a snort of irritation.<br><br>Hadley bestowed a quick kiss on Sarinda's cheek before he led her firmly back to the sofa. Sarinda resumed her place, but An'gel noted that the blonde's gaze never left Hadley's face. He kissed both Arliss and Lottie on the cheek quickly before he approached An'gel.<br><br>Was it her imagination, or did his eyes light up as he gazed into hers? An'gel couldn't remember the last time she had blushed over anything, but now she was convinced her face had flushed. Dickce would rag on her for the rest of her days.</p><h2>A Philosophy of Walking</h2><p><i>&#x201c;It is only ideas gained from walking that&nbsp;have any worth.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;Nietzsche</i><br><br> In <i>A Philosophy of Walking</i>, a bestseller&nbsp;in France, leading thinker Fr�d�ric&nbsp;Gros charts the many different ways&nbsp;we get from A to B &#x2013;&nbsp;the pilgrimage,&nbsp;the promenade, the protest march, the&nbsp;nature ramble&nbsp;&#x2013;&nbsp;and reveals what they&nbsp;say about us.<br><br> Gros draws attention to other&nbsp;thinkers who also saw walking as&nbsp;something central to their practice.&nbsp;On his travels he ponders Thoreau&#x2019;s eager&nbsp;seclusion in Walden Woods; the reason&nbsp;Rimbaud walked in a fury, while Nerval&nbsp;rambled to cure his melancholy.

Shoddy science, sketchy politics, and shady special interests have shaped American Dietary recommendations--and destroyed our nation's health--over recent decades. The phrase "death by food pyramid" isn't shock-value sensationalism, but the tragic consequence of following federal advice and corporate manipulation in pursuit of health.<br><br> In <i>Death by Food Pyramid</i>, Denise Minger exposes the forces that overrode common sense and solid science to launch a pyramid phenomenon that bled far beyond US borders to taint the eating habits of the entire developed world.<br><br> Minger explores how generations of flawed pyramids and plates endure as part of the national consciousness, and how the "one size fits all" diet mentality these icons convey pushes us deeper into the throes of obesity and disease. Regardless of whether you're an omnivore or vegan, research junkie or science-phobe, health novice or seasoned dieter, <i>Death by Food Pyramid</i> will reframe your understanding of nutrition science--and inspire you to take your health, and your future, into your own hands.</p><p><p>Denise Minger is a Portland, OR-based health writer and lecturer with a reputation for aggressively challenging today's leading voices of conventional wisdom. Her meticulously researched critiques decimating USDA guidelines and The China Study--published on her blog, RawFoodSOS.com--have made her a major player in the progressive health community, and a major thorn in the side of both mainstream nutritionists other health figures promoting flawed dietary dogma.</p></p><h2>Blood and Guts: A Short History of Medicine</h2><p><p><strong>"Ideas tumble out of Porter like wonders from some scholarly horn of plenty." &#x2015;Sherwin B. Nuland, <em>The New Republic</em></strong></p><p>An eminently readable, entertaining romp through the history of our vain and valiant efforts to heal ourselves. Mankind's battle to stay alive and healthy for as long as possible is our oldest, most universal struggle. With his characteristic wit and vastly informed historical scope, Roy Porter examines the war fought between disease and doctors on the battleground of the flesh from ancient times to the present. He explores the many ingenious ways in which we have attempted to overcome disease through the ages: the changing role of doctors, from ancient healers, apothecaries, and blood-letters to today's professionals; the array of drugs, from Ayurvedic remedies to the launch of Viagra; the advances in surgery, from amputations performed by barbers without anesthetic to today's sophisticated transplants; and the transformation of hospitals from Christian places of convalescence to modern medical powerhouses. Cleverly illustrated with historic line drawings, the chronic ailments of humanity provide vivid anecdotes for Porter's enlightening story of medicine's efforts to prevail over a formidable and ever-changing adversary.</p></p><p>Roy Porter (1946&#x2015;2002) was professor of the history of medicine at University College, London. His books include Blood and Guts, The Creation of the Modern World, Flesh in the Age of Reason, and The Greatest Benefit to Mankind, winner of the Los Angeles Times Book Award.The death of Roy Porter at the age of 55 years in early 2002 was a grievous loss for both the scholarly community and the general public. One of the most prolific historians of his generation, Porter wrote and edited about 80 books. In a world of specialization, he was an exception. His first book dealt with the history of geology; subsequently, his attention shifted to 18th-century medicine and the history of psychiatry. But he never was confined by period or subject. In 1994 he published London: A Social History (London: Hamish Hamilton), which was followed three years later by The Greatest Benefit to Mankind: A Medical History of Humanity (Hammersmith, London: HarperCollins), an 800-page tome that spanned the centuries from the ancient Greeks to the present. Porter was also a catalyst; he encouraged scholars to ask novel questions and to examine untraditional sources. His works on 18th-century medicine and his emphasis on the need to understand patients as well as physicians opened new horizons. Beyond his scholarly activities, he reached a broad audience through public lectures and radio and television appearances. His dynamic personality, his humor, and his sense of irony appealed to both scholars and the general public. Blood and Guts -- a brief book, running to fewer than 60,000 words -- originated in lecture courses given at the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at University College London. In breathtaking and fearless fashion, Porter surveys Western medicine from antiquity to the present. The history of medicine, he suggests, is not synonymous with the history of physicians. On the contrary, the subject involves complex interactions of human beings, disease patterns, and healers set within societies and cultures that each have their own unique beliefs. The chapters cover such topics as disease patterns, healers, the investigation of the body, the emergence of the biomedical model of disease, therapeutics, surgery, and the hospital. Nowhere was change linear; heated debates invariably accompanied theory, practice, and discussions dealing with appropriate institutional and structural forms of medicine. In the final chapter Porter assesses the broad sociopolitical and economic implications of the health care industry, which in the United States now accounts for about 15 percent of the gross domestic product yet leaves about 40 million persons without insurance coverage. Although the evolution of medical thinking and practice occurred in an international setting, Porter emphasizes national differences as well as similarities. In Britain, for example, the National Insurance Act of 1911 and the founding of the National Health Service in 1948 ensured that primary care would remain in the hands of generalist family physicians, whose role was to be gatekeepers for hospitals and specialists. In the United States, by contrast, general practice lost out to specialism. In both nations, medical care, increasingly driven by bureaucracy and technology, helped to undermine the element of trust between patient and doctor, thus contributing to the revitalization of alternative medicine. By the end of the 20th century, for example, there were more registered alternative healers in Britain than general practitioners; in the United States there were 425 million visits to providers of unconventional therapy, as compared with 388 million visits to primary care physicians. In such an inclusive and brief book, inevitably some statements are open to challenge. Porter repeats the familiar claim that diseases of affluence, such as cancer and coronary heart disease, result from Western lifestyles that include fatty diets, junk foods, cigarettes, alcohol, and drugs. The data supporting such a claim, however, are less than persuasive. With the exception of the connection between lung cancer and smoking, the cause of most cancers remains unknown. Similarly, the relation between coronary heart disease and risk factors is at best murky. Deaths from coronary heart disease rose sharply during the first half of the 20th century, when most of the risk factors mentioned were absent, and fell dramatically in the second half, when they peaked. Porter also repeats the famous statement attributed to Surgeon General William Stewart in 1969 that the war against infectious disease had been won. Stewart never made such a statement, even though many persist in attributing it to him. Those who are knowledgeable about the history of medicine will find relatively little that is new in this brief book, but Blood and Guts is a delightful and informative introduction to an important subject by one of the outstanding scholars of his generation. The book may even lead some readers to follow up by reading Porter's magisterial work, The Greatest Benefit to Mankind. <i>Gerald N. Grob, Ph.D.</i><br>Copyright � 2003 Massachusetts Medical Society.

By placing black schooling within a political, cultural, and economic context, he offers fresh insights into black commitment to education, the peculiar significance of Tuskegee Institute, and the conflicting goals of various philanthropic groups, among other matters. <br><br>Initially, ex-slaves attempted to create an educational system that would support and extend their emancipation, but their children were pushed into a system of industrial education that presupposed black political and economic subordination. This conception of education and social order--supported by northern industrial philanthropists, some black educators, and most southern school officials--conflicted with the aspirations of ex-slaves and their descendants, resulting at the turn of the century in a bitter national debate over the purposes of black education. Because blacks lacked economic and political power, white elites were able to control the structure and content of black elementary, secondary, normal, and college education during the first third of the twentieth century. Nonetheless, blacks persisted in their struggle to develop an educational system in accordance with their own needs and desires.<br><br></p><p>"In its unmatched survey of the primary sources of black education, its provocative judgments, and its ability to recapture the voices of southern blacks striving for educational equity despite great obstacles, <i>The Education of Blacks in the South</i> stands as a notable scholarly achievement."-- <i>Georgia Historical Quarterly</i> <br>James Anderson critically reinterprets the history of southern black education from Reconstruction to the Great Depression.

Legs crossed at the ankles, the woman rested her back lazily against the skinny trunk. She held a cigarette in her right hand, and it was as if the thin white tube were a part of her and the stylish smoke that swirled from it an extension of her body. The woman&#x2019;s fingernails, satin red and glistening, were perfectly shaped. Toenails visible to Violet through peep-toes winked the same shade of crimson. The woman wore a formfitting sheath of celery green with a scoop neckline. A magazine lay open on her lap, but her tortoiseshell sunglasses hid her eyes, so Violet couldn&#x2019;t tell whether the woman was reading the article on the left page or gazing at handsome Cary Grant, whose photograph graced the right. A wad of wax paper lay crumpled on the bench beside her handbag and a bit of bread crust poked out of it. She sat in front of the Mansion at Selznick International Studios, the stunning white edifice that moviemaker Thomas Ince had built back in the twenties to look like George Washington&#x2019;s Mount Vernon.</p><p>The woman under the tree didn&#x2019;t look at all like a fellow studio secretary, but rather a highly paid actress catching a few quiet moments of solitude between takes on the back lot. Violet glanced around to see whether there was someone else sitting outside the Mansion on her noon break. But the woman in front of her was the only one eating her lunch under a palm tree, and that was where Violet had been told she&#x2019;d find Audrey Duvall. She suddenly looked familiar to Violet, which made no sense at all. Violet was two thousand miles away from anything remotely connected to home.</p><p>&#x201c;Miss Duvall?&#x201d; Violet said.</p><p>The woman looked up drowsily, as though Violet had awakened her from sleep. She cocked her head and pulled her sunglasses down slightly to peer at Violet over the rims. Her luminous eyes, beautiful and doelike, were fringed with long lashes she couldn&#x2019;t have been born with. The casual glance was the wordless reply that she was indeed Audrey Duvall.</p><p>&#x201c;My name&#x2019;s Violet Mayfield. I&#x2019;m new to the secretary pool. Millie in accounts payable told me you are looking for a roommate. I was wondering if you&#x2019;d found one yet.&#x201d;</p><p>Audrey smiled and her painted lips parted to reveal moon-white teeth. &#x201c;Good Lord,&#x201d; she exclaimed, her voice rich and resonant, almost as deep as a man&#x2019;s. &#x201c;Where are you from?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Pardon me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not from around here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Um. No. I&#x2019;m from Alabama. Originally.&#x201d;</p><p>Audrey&#x2019;s smile deepened. &#x201c;Alabama. Never been to Alabama.&#x201d;</p><p>Violet didn&#x2019;t know what to say. Had the woman not heard what she asked?</p><p>Audrey patted the empty space next to her. &#x201c;Have a seat. What did you say your name was?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Violet Mayfield.&#x201d; She sat down, and the cement beneath her was warm from the sun despite it being early December.</p><p>Audrey lifted the cigarette gently to her mouth and its end glowed red as she inhaled. When she tipped her head back and released the smoke it wafted over her head like a feathery length of gauze.</p><p>&#x201c;Want one?&#x201d; She nodded toward the pack of cigarettes peeking out of her handbag.</p><p>&#x201c;No, thanks.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t smoke?&#x201d; Audrey puffed again on the cigarette and smiled as the smoke drifted past her lips.</p><p>Violet shook her head.</p><p>&#x201c;My last roommate didn&#x2019;t, either. She was always leaving the windows open to let the smoke out.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did you not like it when she left the windows open? Is that why you need a new roommate?&#x201d;</p><p>Audrey laughed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re kidding, right?&#x201d;</p><p>Violet said nothing.</p><p>&#x201c;She got married.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d;</p><p>Audrey pushed the sunglasses up onto her head, fully revealing shining tea-brown eyes that complemented her shimmering brunette hair. She seemed to study for a moment Violet&#x2019;s navy blue dress with its plain white collar. Violet&#x2019;s mousy brown hair&#x2014;far less wavy than Audrey&#x2019;s&#x2014;was pulled back into a beaded barrette she had bought in a five-and-dime on the day she started heading west.</p><p>&#x201c;So you just moved, then? From Alabama?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I came by way of Shreveport, actually. I&#x2019;ve been working for my uncle the past year. He&#x2019;s an accountant.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And how long have you been here?&#x201d; Audrey asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Two weeks.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you found a job that quickly?&#x201d; Her tone held a faint edge of sly admiration. &#x201c;Good for you!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve worked in an office before,&#x201d; Violet said quickly. &#x201c;And I went to secretary school.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard there&#x2019;s a school for what we do,&#x201d; Audrey said, amused. &#x201c;What are you? Nineteen? Twenty?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Twenty-two.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That will come in handy here, looking younger than you really are,&#x201d; Audrey murmured. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m thirty and can still pass for a twenty-year-old if I need to.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why would you need to do that?&#x201d;</p><p>Audrey tossed back her head and laughed. Even her laugh was low and rich. &#x201c;You seem to have a knack for humor, Violet from Alabama.&#x201d; She arched one penciled eyebrow. &#x201c;So. Did you come to Hollywood to be a movie star?&#x201d;</p><p>Violet startled at the question. &#x201c;No!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why most girls your age come here.&#x201d;</p><p>The thought of performing in front of people didn&#x2019;t interest Violet in the least. Hollywood had beckoned her for a different reason. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not why I moved here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No?&#x201d;</p><p>Her motivation for coming to California apparently mattered to Audrey Duvall. &#x201c;I met one of Mr. Selznick&#x2019;s talent scouts at an audition in Shreveport. He said he&#x2019;d put in a good word for me if I wanted a secretarial job at the studio.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You went to that audition?&#x201d; Audrey&#x2019;s eyes widened in measurable interest.</p><p>&#x201c;Only because my cousin Lucinda insisted I come with her. She found out people from Hollywood were coming to Shreveport to search for a young woman to play Scarlett O&#x2019;Hara. I let her talk me into being interviewed along with everyone else. I think by the time Mr. Arnow got to me he was just relieved to talk to someone who had actually read Margaret Mitchell&#x2019;s book and wasn&#x2019;t fawning all over him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t say!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I told him I was a much better secretary than I was an actress and that I knew stenography, and that I&#x2019;d lived in the South all my life. He told me if I wanted a job at Selznick International in Hollywood, he&#x2019;d put in a good word for me. He said it would be handy to have a Southerner in the secretary pool during the filming. So I came.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just like that?&#x201d; Audrey seemed both intrigued and dubious.</p><p>Violet nodded.</p><p>&#x201c;You have a family back there missing you right now?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just my parents. And my two brothers, Jackson and Truman. They&#x2019;re both married now and raising families. I doubt they think about me much.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But your parents?&#x201d;</p><p>Violet&#x2019;s thoughts somersaulted back to the strained phone call she had placed from Shreveport, telling her parents she&#x2019;d been offered a job in Los Angeles and was taking it. They had begged her to reconsider.</p><p>&#x201c;Come back home to Montgomery!&#x201d; her mother had pleaded.</p><p>&#x201c;Come back home to what?&#x201d; Violet had responded. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing for me there.&#x201d;</p><p>Daddy had asked what California had that Alabama didn&#x2019;t. She hadn&#x2019;t known how to express that Hollywood didn&#x2019;t have expectations of her.</p><p>Or sad memories of what might have been.</p><p>&#x201c;I suppose they miss me,&#x201d; Violet answered.</p><p>Audrey cocked her head. &#x201c;So, what made you come all this way, if you don&#x2019;t want to be a star?&#x201d;</p><p>But Violet&#x2019;s reason was too personal to share with a virtual stranger. She was not going to tell someone she&#x2019;d only just met that fully realizing she could never have the life she&#x2019;d been raised to live and wanted to live had sent her scrabbling for a new foothold on a meaningful existence.</p><p>&#x201c;I was ready for a different life with new opportunities,&#x201d; Violet said, with a slight shrug of her left shoulder.</p><p>For a stretched moment Audrey stared at her. &#x201c;Then you came to the right place,&#x201d; she finally said. &#x201c;Are you allergic to cats?&#x201d; She took a long pull on her cigarette.</p><p>Violet shook her head.</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have any furniture, do you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just a suitcase. I&#x2019;ve been staying at a hotel.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The rent is sixty dollars a month. Plus half of the utilities.&#x201d; Audrey dropped the stub of the cigarette to the pavement and ground it out with her shoe. &#x201c;My place is a bit out of the way. Eight miles by way of bus and the red car. It&#x2019;s a very pretty neighborhood, though. Close to the hills and the Hollywoodland sign. It was my aunt&#x2019;s house. But now it&#x2019;s mine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The red car?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The trolley. The streetcar. It&#x2019;s a good thirty minutes getting there in the morning and just as long or more at night. Still interested?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. Yes, I am.&#x201d;</p><p>Audrey smiled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m on loan to one of the assistant art directors the next few days, so how about you meet me out front at quitting time? We can take the red car together so you can see the place and decide.&#x201d; She rose from the bench, clutching the magazine and the handbag. &#x201c;C&#x2019;mon. You don&#x2019;t want to be late getting back.&#x201d;</p><p>Audrey strolled confidently to toss the wax paper into a trash can some yards away and Violet had to quicken her step to catch up. Audrey&#x2019;s attention was fixed on the people they passed, some wearing elaborate costumes, some street clothes, some moving leisurely, some rushing as though desperate to catch a departing train. A few of these people Audrey greeted by name; some she did not. But everyone was given a look.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>At a few minutes after five, Violet was at the front gate, waiting for Audrey to join her. When fifteen minutes had passed and there was still no sign of her, Violet was ready to assume she&#x2019;d been forgotten. She had just decided to head back to her hotel when she saw Audrey walking slowly toward the gate, in the company of a man in a suit. They were laughing as they sauntered in her direction. He broke away before they reached the gate to head to one of the sound stages.</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry about that,&#x201d; Audrey said easily when she reached Violet. &#x201c;But that fellow is not one to rush away from. Ready?&#x201d;</p><p>They set out toward the Pacific Electric trolley stop, alighting onto a Venice Line car seconds before it set off east toward the Hollywood foothills. The streetcar had made a few stops before the two women were able to find two seats together. They sank into the last double seat at the rear.</p><p>&#x201c;So, have you lived here a long time?&#x201d; Violet asked as they settled more comfortably.</p><p>Audrey looked out the window at the passing scenery. &#x201c;I suppose I have. I came when I was sixteen to live with my aunt.&#x201d; She turned with a half grin on her lips toward Violet. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not from here, either. I was raised four hours north on a plum farm. I&#x2019;m a farm girl.&#x201d;</p><p>The image of stunning Audrey Duvall as a pigtailed tomboy in dungarees made Violet smile for only a second. Sixteen seemed a young age to have left home. Violet&#x2019;s own parents had been distraught when she told them she was heading to Hollywood, and she was a grown woman.</p><p>&#x201c;And your parents let you come?&#x201d; Violet asked.</p><p>Audrey laughed lightly. &#x201c;My father pretty much insisted on it.&#x201d;</p><p>Sorrow and disappointment laced Audrey&#x2019;s words despite the grin. Violet was instantly curious to know what had happened between Audrey and her father. But it would have been rude to ask.</p><p>&#x201c;And your mother?&#x201d; Violet said instead.</p><p>Again Audrey&#x2019;s gaze turned to the passing sights on the street. They were leaving the dull and drab neighborhoods of Culver City, where the studio was located, and entering the charm and glamour of Hollywood. &#x201c;She died when I was ten.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry.&#x201d;</p><p>Audrey was quiet for a moment. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have any regrets about coming to Hollywood, but I do wonder sometimes where I would be right now if my mother had lived.&#x201d; She turned her head to face Violet again. &#x201c;Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if different things had happened to you?&#x201d;</p><p>Violet thought of her childhood friends back home who were all engaged, married, or pregnant, blissfully enjoying the existence she had always pictured herself living. It was such an ordinary life, but she had wanted it. She still wanted it.</p><p>&#x201c;All the time,&#x201d; Violet answered.</p><p>The streetcar stopped and a dozen passengers around them maneuvered their way off the trolley.

He currently lives in Oxford and writes full-time.</p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s the one.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She wore black jeans, red top, a black leather jacket; she had dark curly hair and was old&#x2014;forty, fifty, somewhere round that&#x2014;with a shoulder bag that swung like an invitation: banging heavy on her hip, loaded with purses, credit cards and women&#x2019;s stuff; everything she&#x2019;d need in the big bad city. Definite out-of-towner. She should have had <i>victim</i> tattooed on her forehead.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yessss . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Andrew, who answered to Dig these days, let it out in one long breath.<i> Yessss.</i> She was the one. You waited long enough, your ticket to the party arrived. The party started tomorrow&#x2014;all around, the old millennium drained away like dirty water from a sink&#x2014;and here she was, just the ticket: a bag with a bag. Drifting down the arcade, her attention swallowed by a glittery window&#x2019;s expensive promises: they&#x2019;d have the bag, that jacket off her back even, and all she&#x2019;d ever know about it was Some You Lose. The credit cards, the money, were as good as in their pockets.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beside him, Wez muttered something purple-sounding. He looked like he&#x2019;d melt in your mouth, but had a vocabulary could stop a train.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And another spat of water hit Dig&#x2019;s neck. They were leaning on one of the concrete stanchions that supported the building overhead, and once every couple of minutes enough moisture gathered up there to loosen and splash on Dig&#x2019;s neck. It would have been pussy to move because he was dripped on. So the thing was to pretend it wasn&#x2019;t happening, or if it was, that he liked it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The way the woman walked&#x2014;her bag slung over one shoulder; her left hand resting lightly on its clasp&#x2014;she might never have been out of her village before.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two hundred yards up the road, the Tube swallowed travellers. Here in the arcade, pedestrian traffic was slight: the shops were a low-rent jeweller&#x2019;s, a hardware store, a CostCutter, a chemist&#x2019;s, a dry-cleaner&#x2019;s, a newsagent&#x2019;s, a bagel outlet. It was the jeweller&#x2019;s Black-and-Red faltered by. Dig had checked that window out himself: all crap, even he knew that. Naff engagement rings, and stuff, you hung it round your neck, you&#x2019;d look like Miss Piggy on a bad hair day. <i>The bigger the stone, the cheaper the lady</i> his bastard father used to say. This lady didn&#x2019;t look cheap, just old, and he wondered what she was doing here, where the shops were end-of-line, and all the expensive promises broken as soon as unwrapped. And then he thought: <i>She must have been to the concert hall</i>&#x2014;there was a concert hall tucked inside the labyrinth&#x2014;a concert hall and a museum and some other shit. Black-and-Red must have spent the afternoon doing culture, and wandered past the Tube in the hope of finding more.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wez said, &#x201c;Dumb fuckbunny&#x2019;s about to have a shit-fit.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dig drew on his cigarette, and breathed out heavily&#x2014;the cloud adding to the afternoon&#x2019;s mistiness; to the damp, the grime, the oil-patterned puddles at the kerbs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wez said, &#x201c;Fuckin twatlegs&#x2019;ll wish she&#x2019;d stayed home,&#x201d; and threw his own cigarette into the gutter.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The real clouds, what showed of them above the office blocks and skyline furniture, were an angry grey mess. The pavements shone weakly, stealing light from nearby windows. Dig tugged at his top&#x2019;s broken zipper. There was smoke in the air from some distant accident, and more in his lungs from a stolen Marlboro, and water poured down his neck in a fine white wash of reality, and the woman was moving again&#x2014;coming towards them, the bag slapping happily against her hip&#x2014;and his insides clenched with the inevitability of everything, and he looked at Wez, voice hardly cracking at all when he said, &#x201c;Ready?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Wez looked pure scorn, because Wez was <i>born</i> ready, and this was his meat and drink. Was how he knew he was awake and breathing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dig freed himself from his pillar like, probably, some old statue coming to life, just as his cigarette scorched to the knuckle . . . He shook his hand and it jumped away, scattering sparks against the bagel joint&#x2019;s fogged window. This was <i>attention</i>, mad enough to get the stares coming, but the dumb bitch hadn&#x2019;t noticed; she&#x2019;d turned to look at something&#x2014;Get Two Suits Cleaned And We&#x2019;ll Clean A Third One Free!&#x2014;so missed the fireworks; missed, too, Wez&#x2019;s split-second fury&#x2014;<i>Cunt</i> he mouthed, then turned and headed towards Black-and-Red, side-stepping to her right maybe twenty foot in front. Dig watched the stub tumble cartwheels in the draught, bloom one last time against a greengrocer&#x2019;s crate, then he set off to take his place in the dance.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . Once, the bitch-mother had taken him to the ballet. That was what she&#x2019;d called it: <i>The</i> ballet. He&#x2019;d thought there was only one. And it was strange how some things you carried regardless: along with a couple of scribbled-over nursery memories, and a trace of her perfume he&#x2019;d caught last night up west, he had the startling picture in his head sometimes of people producing impossible leaps and mid-air twirls; their limbs strangers to gravity, their hands gripping invisible ropes from which they swung like uncaged monkeys. <i>So beautifully choreographed, darling</i> she&#x2019;d said afterwards, practising for her friends while she lit a cigarette and stared into the crowds in the hope of somebody interesting. And: <i>So beautifully choreographed</i> he thought now, as Wez slipped the bag from the woman with a touch light as a ghost&#x2019;s, and turned and tossed it to Dig so sweetly it fell into his open arms even as he started to run&#x2014;and this was what Dig did best. This was why Wez let him hang: it was Dig&#x2019;s run; nothing to flat-out whirlwind in Point Zero. Wez tarried long enough to do the rest&#x2014;he pushed the woman sideways, with just enough footwork she hit the deck&#x2014;then took off too. But Dig was away by then; darting like his feet were on fire the length of the arcade, and up the redbrick walkway, and into the concrete labyrinth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was heavy. That was the first and most important thing: this bag was heavy. Like the bitch collected bricks or something, except whatever it was, it wasn&#x2019;t bricks, and even while he was running, imagined contents took root in his head: what did she have in here, this bottomless black leather bag with its big clasp? Maybe she was stopping in town for tomorrow&#x2019;s blast, and this held her party gear: not just the money, the credit cards, the <i>stuff</i>, but strings of jewels, diamond tiaras, lengths of precisely numbered rubies. You never knew what you&#x2019;d got till it was done. His feet had wings; they barely touched the walkway. At the top, he hit a hard left, then twisted right down a flight of steps: Dig was down them in one and a half clicks, and here came the danger&#x2014;the big sprint across open space with bricked-in flowerbeds and litter bins, overlooked on all sides by office windows&#x2014;here you could be spotted; your direction mapped; your destination guessed. He hugged the bag tighter. Today, he was winged. Today, the offices were deserted; everybody heading home, or filling the bars with their bigmouth suit-and-tie voices. He reached the shelter of the opposite side, the comfort of the next stairwell&#x2014;up now, three steps a stride, which brought him to another walkway, this one bridging a traffic-choked road to end in a mini-plaza with a wide-fronted entrance to a museum or something, closed already. He ducked a loop of builder&#x2019;s tape warning about overhead work which wasn&#x2019;t happening, and into another stairwell, and then there were only two flights to go, and he was safe&#x2014;there was a spot down here Wez had fixed on, and if Wez said it was safe, it was safe. Wez knew what was what. Dig was the legs but Wez was everything else, and both knew it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The breath was hammering out of him in short hard bursts: his heart pounding, blood racing. Everything. He was alive, and it was all working.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The safe spot was a dark corner near the intersection of two walkways one flight from the car park; a strange nook the labyrinth&#x2019;s interlocking architecture had thrown up: accident or design, didn&#x2019;t matter. It smelt appallingly of piss. Waiting, Dig hefted the bag to shoulder height. Pretty weighty, yes. But he wouldn&#x2019;t open it till Wez arrived. That was the rule. Truth told he was scared of Wez, who had no boundaries.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hand on his shoulder nearly killed him. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wez said, &#x201c;All be dope?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dig swallowed the cry; re-anchored his heart. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s . . . cool.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Less check the stash.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wez reached and took the bag from Dig like cigarettes from a baby, but even he noted the weight&#x2014;a sudden collapse at the wrist before he could correct it, correct <i>gravity</i>, and Dig felt a quick rush of pride: he had stolen this.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;She carryin fuckin stones.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not stones, Wez.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;She carryin fuckin<i> leadweights</i>, dickweed.&#x201d; But there was a gleam in his eye, and Dig knew Wez didn&#x2019;t think that; that there weren&#x2019;t no leadweights here, but pirates' treasure.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It be dope,&#x201d; he said, and felt the words come almost naturally; as if he were what they sounded like he were: king of the fucking streets, bigtime.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wez was unzipping the bag.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A splash grabbed Dig&#x2019;s neck&#x2014;even here, buried out of reach of the weather, there was no escaping the damp.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What Wez pulled out was, indeed, a brick.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple of seconds they stood, looking at the brick in Wez&#x2019;s hand like it was the Ark of the Covenant. Another splash hit the stones. Wez opened his mouth. The sounds he&#x2019;d been going to make disappeared.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Dig jerked backwards, and whatever grabbed him this time was fiercer than raindrops. He made to squawk, but air vanished; it was half a second before he realized that an arm had scooped and clenched round his middle; an arm sleeved in black, with red at the cuff . . . He deflated instantly, and then his arms were wrenched back, and something snapped into place. He couldn&#x2019;t move. He couldn&#x2019;t breathe. Hands seized his collar and he was pulled backwards so abruptly he lost his footing; he was sprawling now, aching for breath. And the rain was coming down harder and he was flapping on the stones man, flapping on the fucking stones, and couldn&#x2019;t breathe, and it was the bitch with the bag, the bitch with the fucking bag, and all it held was bricks, and he couldn&#x2019;t breathe, and it was raining, and she was over him like fucking Wonder Woman or something, and if he didn&#x2019;t breathe soon he&#x2019;d fucking die . . . They were handcuffs. The bitch had fucking cuffed him. And where was Wez: Wez was still in the fucking cubby. He breathed at last. The air felt like on fire.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wez emerged, looking smaller, looking grey. &#x201c;Fuck you at, bitch?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She held a palm out flat, like she was stopping traffic. Then bent and pulled at Dig&#x2019;s cuffs, so he was yanked to his feet like a puppet.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He still wasn&#x2019;t breathing properly. There were laws said you couldn&#x2019;t do this, couldn&#x2019;t just <i>squeeze</i> and <i>cuff</i> and <i>yank</i> people less you were a copper, and the horrible news hit him like that: she was a copper. What else was she? And his brain ran ragged, because a copper meant the beautiful game was over.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wez was smiling. Dig had seen that smile before. It didn&#x2019;t signify happy. &#x201c;Muffcruncher,&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Back off.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And <i>This isn&#x2019;t her</i>, thought Dig. This wasn&#x2019;t the slack-jawed woman they&#x2019;d watched trawling the arcade, carrying her bag like a victim tourist&#x2014;this voice was hard; it came from a place you didn&#x2019;t want to run into full tilt. It was a voice with rocks in it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Fuckin twat merchant,&#x201d; said Wez bravely. It was as if he still didn&#x2019;t get it, but he got it. Beneath the words, Dig could hear something he&#x2019;d never heard before from Wez; never imagined he&#x2019;d hear from him. He was scared. But he was still giving it lip. &#x201c;Bitch.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there was pain in Dig&#x2019;s wrists as he was pulled again: he was on his feet, and they were on the move. The woman took as much notice of Wez as if he were bruised fruit.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had one hand on his collar and the other on the chain linking his wrists. He&#x2019;d twist free any second; fling her away; give her some footwork&#x2014;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He kept marching.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And two yards back Wez danced; never getting so close he was help or hindrance. &#x201c;Dishwashin scumsucker. Gunna give you fuckin <i>grief</i> lady, gunna give you fuckin<i> ballsache</i> . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were on the stairs now; he was being pushed down the stairs, her hand firm on the cuff-chain, so he couldn&#x2019;t fall. The woman&#x2019;s hand felt like cable. Wez&#x2019;s voice wobbled after them, then his body followed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You juss fuckin <i>slice</i> bitch, you slice waitin to happen . . .&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Words tumbling out of him, and all Dig could feel, could think, was <i>It&#x2019;s over. The game is over.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His hands ached, his chest ached, but at least he was breathing freely now as he was propelled in the direction of some piece-of-shit Nissan Sunny, anything less like an unmarked car he had <i>yet to fucking see</i> . . . Everything came to a halt when he was slammed against its bodywork.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You&#x2019;re getting in,&#x201d; her voice said. &#x201c;And no fuss.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The door opened. Her hand squashing his head, he was poured into the back seat, which was what it felt like: poured. Outside, maintaining safe distance, Wez hovered.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You lookin at <i>pain</i> bitch is what you lookin at . . .&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She could be anybody, thought Dig. Could be some serial pervert, and the next I&#x2019;m known of, I&#x2019;ll be body parts in bags.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wez came closer while Black-and-Red made an important suggestion to Dig. &#x201c;Mark my car, and I&#x2019;m taking it out of your hide. Are we together on this?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said <i>muh</i>&#x2014;or <i>wuh</i>&#x2014;. It wasn&#x2019;t clear which.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</p><h2>Conquering Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and Other Repetitive Strain Injuries: A Self-Care Program</h2><p>This book offers a complete self-care program for those at risk and those already suffering from one of the most common and most debilitating occupational injuries. Guided by symptom charts, you select the best exercises for the movement patterns required by your work and learn how to restore the range of motion to overworked hands and arms.</p><p>Sharon Butler was working as a massage therapist and Hellerwork practitioner when she developed carpal tunnel syndrome and tendonitis. Unable to sleep through the night because of the pain and concerned about her livelihood, she built upon her knowledge of connective tissue and developed a series of stretching exercises to gently relieve the tension in her body. After daily stretching in this way, her pain soon subsided. To prove that these exercises weren't just a fluke, Butler intentionally overworked her body to bring back her symptoms. While this may not have been the smartest move, her stretching program again relieved her pain. <p> The magic behind her powerful exercises is their focus on fascial tissue. Fascia, which is stronger than steel, holds the body together. It wraps around muscle fibers, bones, and tendons. (If you've ever looked at an uncooked piece of chicken and noticed the glistening white layer over the meat, you've seen fascia.) In people who overwork their bodies, the fascia hardens, a natural response to prevent future injury. Unfortunately, this stiffness worsens with repeated insults to the body. Muscles, nerves, and tendons tense up and inflame even more and may even adhere to each other. Metabolic waste products can build up and become trapped instead of being carried away by the lymph system, and even more pressure is placed on the affected body tissues. </p><p> Enter Butler's exercises. The book is arranged to let you pick and choose the correct stretches to suit your needs. Too much typing, guitar playing, or gardening? Stiff neck, tingling fingers, sore upper arms, or all three? However you developed your repetitive strain injury and whatever your upper-body symptoms (or if you're smart and you'd like to prevent such problems), there are multiple stretches in <i>Conquering Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</i> to suit your needs. The book is arranged to help users develop a personalized stretching program with more than 40 stretches for the upper body, forearms, wrists, fingers, and thumbs to choose from. Butler thoroughly explains the importance of stretching and the correct (and incorrect) way to do it, and the exercises are lucidly illustrated.</p>The leading occupational injury of the 90&#39;s will soon become a thing of the past. This is the most complete program ever developed for the relief of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome or other repetitive strain injury of the upper body. You will learn everything you need for true self-care: learn how soft-tissues function and why they develop repetitive strain injuries; discover how gentle stretching can help restore full function and comfort to your hands, arms, neck and shoulders; choose the most appropriate exercises to relieve your symptoms by reviewing the Symptoms Charts included in this program; and create an effective injury prevention program based on your occupation.</p><h2>The Secret History of Mermaids</h2><p><strong>From the loremaster who brought us THE SECRET HISTORY OF GIANTS comes an intriguing new chronicle revealing the mysterious ways of merfolk.</strong><br><br>Since ancient times, seafarers and coast-dwellers the world over have reported encounters with merpeople.

Using a womanist methodological approach, Pamela R. Lightsey helps readers explore the impact of oppression against Black LBTQ women while introducing them to the emergent intellectual movement known as queer theology. The author privileges their narratives and experiences as she reviews several doctrines and dogma of the Christian church. Theological reflection on contemporary debates such as same-sex marriage and ordination rights make this book a valuable resource to clergy, students of theology, LGBTQ persons and allies.</p><p>Pamela R.

Or Ray Bradbury's classic <i>The Halloween Tree</i>. Eight boys set out on a Halloween night and are led into the depths of the past by a tall, mysterious character named Moundshroud. They ride on a black wind to autumn scenes in distant lands and times, where they witness other ways of celebrating this holiday about the dark time of year. Bradbury's lyrical prose whooshes along with the pell-mell rhythms of children running at night, screaming and laughing, and the reader is carried along by its sheer exuberance. <p> Bradbury's stories about children are always attended by dread--of change, adulthood, death. <i>The Halloween Tree</i>, while sweeter than his adult literature, is also touched at moments by the cold specter of loss--which is only fitting, of course, for a holiday in honor of the waning of the sun. </p><p> This is a superb book for adults to read to children, a way to teach them, quite painlessly, about customs and imagery related to Halloween from ancient Egypt, Mediterranean cultures, Celtic Druidism, Mexico, and even a cathedral in Paris. (One caveat, though: Bradbury unfortunately perpetuates a couple of misconceptions about <i>Samhain</i>, or summer's end, the Halloween of ancient Celts and contemporary pagans.)

Moraes "Moor" Zogoiby, the last surviving scion of a dynasty of Cochinese spice merchants and crime lords, is also a compulsive storyteller and an exile. As he travels a route that takes him from India to Spain, he leaves behind a tale of mad passions and volcanic family hatreds, of titanic matriarchs and their mesmerized offspring, of premature deaths and curses that strike beyond the grave.</p><p>In <b>The Moor's Last Sigh</b> Salman Rushdie revisits some of the same ground he covered in his greatest novel, Midnight's Children. This book is narrated by Moraes Zogoiby, aka Moor, who speaks to us from a grave in Spain. Like Moor, Rushdie knows about a life spent in banishment from normal society--Rushdie because of the death sentence that followed The Satanic Verses, Moor because he ages at twice the rate of normal humans. Yet Moor's story of travail is bigger than Rushdie's; it encompasses a grand struggle between good and evil while Moor himself stands as allegory for Rushdie's home country of India. Filled with wordplay and ripe with humor, it is an epic work.<p>"The most complete and gratifying work to emerge from Salman Rushdie's imagination...The Moor's Last Sign is an exotic story, in its setting, in its characters, in its punning extravagance, and in its deeply human core. It is an extraordinary family saga...full of wonderful characters, and the insight born of genuine reflection...A remarkable spell of creativity." --Edmonton Journal</p><p>"A rich, wonderfully readable novel." --Toronto Star</p><p>"One of the most wonderful works of political art I have encountered, a novel to rival Turgenev's Fathers and Sons, or Dante's Divine Comedy...The Moor's Last Sigh is one of the most admirable novels I've ever read." --Ottawa Citizen</p><br></p><h2>Cultural Apologetics: Renewing the Christian Voice, Conscience, and Imagination in a Disenchanted World</h2><p><p>The post-Christian world we inhabit today presents us with a mundane and disenchanted view of reality. Under the sway of materialism and science, we have been left with a way of seeing, thinking, and living that has no place for beauty and wonder. We now live in a world bereft of magic and mystery.</p><p>Many--including many Christians--no longer perceive the world in its proper light. As a result, the Christian imagination is muted. Moreover, the church has grown anti-intellectual and sensate, out of touch with the relevancy of Jesus and how to relate the gospel to all aspects of contemporary life. As a result, the Christian voice is muted. In this age Christian wholeness remains elusive, blunting the church's ability to present a winsome and compelling witness for faith. As a result, the Christian conscience is muted.</p><p><em>Cultural Apologetics</em> addresses this malaise by setting forth a fresh model for cultural engagement, rooted in the biblical account of Paul's speech on Mars Hill, which details practical steps for reestablishing the Christian voice, conscience, and imagination. Readers will be equipped to see, and help others see, the world as it is--deeply beautiful, mysterious, and sacred.</p><p>With creative insights, <em>Cultural Apologetics</em> prepares readers to share a vision of the Christian faith that is both plausible and desirable, offering clarity for those who have become disoriented in the haze of modern Western culture.</p></p><p></p><h2>Face to Face with Jesus: A Former Muslim&#39;s Extraordinary Journey to Heaven and Encounter with the God of Love</h2><p><b>It starts as a story ripped from the headlines of the war-torn Middle East.</b> An extremist faction of Islam bombs a church during a service.

Answering the charge that Jews should have left earlier, Kaplan shows that far from seeming inevitable, the Holocaust was impossible to foresee precisely because Nazi repression occurred in irregular and unpredictable steps until the massive violence of Novemer 1938. Then the flow of emigration turned into a torrent, only to be stopped by the war. By that time Jews had been evicted from their homes, robbed of their possessions and their livelihoods, shunned by their former friends, persecuted by their neighbors, and driven into forced labor. For those trapped in Germany, mere survival became a nightmare of increasingly desperate options. Many took their own lives to retain at least some dignity in death; others went underground and endured the fears of nightly bombings and the even greater terror of being discovered by the Nazis. Most were murdered. All were pressed to the limit of human endurance and human loneliness.<br><br>Focusing on the fate of families and particularly women's experience, <em>Between Dignity and Despair</em> takes us into the neighborhoods, into the kitchens, shops, and schools, to give us the shape and texture, the very feel of what it was like to be a Jew in Nazi Germany.<br></p><p>As the old saying goes, hindsight is always 20-20; people looking back on the Holocaust and the events leading up to it often wonder why the Jews didn't flee Nazi Germany or why they put up with the prejudice and degradation inflicted upon them by the Nazis. From our perspective, 50 years later, it seems almost incredible that the victims of genocide didn't see it coming and made little effort to escape. But as Marion Kaplan makes clear in her powerful book, <i>Between Dignity and Despair</i>, the choices were much murkier at the time. The Jews didn't leave because Germany was their home and had been for centuries; like everyone else, they had responsibilities and commitments to family, jobs and communities that kept them there. Nor, in the early days of Hitler's regime, could the Jews of Nazi Germany have foreseen the terrible humiliations they would suffer or imagined the horror of the Final Solution. <p> Kaplan's sensitive narrative, supported by a host of letters, memoirs, and interviews, aims to give a balanced account of German Jewry under the Nazi regime. She convincingly shows how it was German society (indoctrinated by Nazi propaganda) that dealt the first crippling moral blow to the Jewish psyche, before any laws dictated their actions. The Jews succumbed to daily humiliations, ranging from little boys being maliciously teased for being circumcised to older Jews being treated like social pariah's by one-time friends who fell easily into the mindset of racial enmity. Hatred breeds hatred; slowly the German populace strangled the pride of the Jews, creating resentment, distrust and disharmony. Kaplan conveys a poignant, yet subtle message: the fundamental de-facto abandonment of decency and moral civility by the gentile Germans was the catalyst which allowed Nazi leadership to proceed with more aggressive policies that ultimately led to the Holocaust.</p><br><b>Marion Kaplan</b> is Professor of Modern Jewish History at NYU.

He has been working with children in their inner-city schools for more than 40 years.Chapter One <br>A Life Among Schoolchildren<br><br>Dear Francesca, <br>I was very happy that you wrote to me and I apologize for taking two weeks to reply. I was visiting schools in other cities in the first part of the month and I didn&#x2019;t have a chance to read your letter carefully until tonight. <br><br>The answer to your question is that I would love to come and visit in your classroom and I&#x2019;m glad that you invited me. I&#x2019;d also like to reassure you that you didn&#x2019;t need to worry that I&#x2019;d think your letter was presumptuous. I like to hear from teachers and, as you have probably suspected, I feel very close to quite a few of them, especially the ones who work with little children in the elementary grades, because those are the grades I used to teach. I think that teaching is a beautiful profession and that teachers of young children do one of the best things that there is to do in life: bring joy and beauty, mystery and mischievous delight into the hearts of little people in their years of greatest curiosity. <br><br>Sometimes when I&#x2019;m visiting a school, a teacher whom I may have met once when she was in college, or with whom I may have corresponded briefly, or a teacher whom I&#x2019;ve never met but who&#x2019;s read one of my books and feels as if she knows me, sees me standing in the corridor and comes right up and tells me, &#x201c;Come and visit in my classroom!&#x201d; Sometimes she doesn&#x2019;t give me any choice. She simply grabs me by the arm and brings me to the classroom. Then, when I get there, typically she puts me on the spot and asks if I would like to teach a lesson or ask questions to her children. <br><br>I love it when teachers let me do this, but I almost always do it wrong at first, because it&#x2019;s been a long time since I was a teacher, and I often ask the kind of question that gets everybody jumping from their seats and speaking out at the same time. Six-year-olds, when they become excited, as you put it in your letter, have &#x201c;only a theoretical connection with their chairs.&#x201d; They do the most remarkable gymnastics to be sure you see them. A little girl sitting right in front of me will wave her fingers in my face, climbing halfway out of her chair, as if she&#x2019;s going to poke me in the eyes if I won&#x2019;t call on her, and making the most heartrending sounds&#x2014;&#x201c;Ooooh! Ooooh! Ooooh! Ooooh!&#x201d;&#x2014;in case I still don&#x2019;t notice that she&#x2019;s there. Then, when I finally call on her, more often than not she forgets the question that I asked, looks up at me in sweet bewilderment, and asks me, &#x201c;What?&#x201d; It turns out she didn&#x2019;t have a thing to say. She just wanted me to recognize that she was there. <br><br>The teacher usually has to bail me out. She folds her arms and gives the class one of those looks that certain teachers do so well, and suddenly decorum is restored. <br><br>It&#x2019;s a humbling experience, but I think that it&#x2019;s a good one too, for someone who writes books on education to come back into the classroom and stand up there as the teacher does day after day and be reminded in this way of what it&#x2019;s like to do the real work of a teacher. I sometimes think that every education writer, every would-be education expert, and every politician who pontificates, as many do so condescendingly, about the &#x201c;failings&#x201d; of the teachers in the front lines of our nation&#x2019;s public schools ought to be obliged to come into a classroom once a year and teach the class, not just for an hour with the TV cameras watching but for an entire day, and find out what it&#x2019;s like. It might at least impart some moderation to the disrespectful tone with which so many politicians speak of teachers. <br><br>In my writings through the course of nearly 40 years, I have always tried to bring the mighty and ferocious educational debates that dominate the pages of the press and academic publications, in which the voices of our teachers are too seldom heard, back from the distant kingdom of intimidation and abstraction&#x2014;lists of &#x201c;mandates,&#x201d; &#x201c;sanctions,&#x201d; and &#x201c;incentives&#x201d; and &#x201c;performance standards&#x201d; and the rest &#x2014;into the smaller, more specific world of colored crayons, chalk erasers, pencil sharpeners, and tiny quarrels, sometimes tears and sometimes uncontrollably contagious jubilation of which daily life for a real teacher and her students is, in fact, composed. <br><br>I&#x2019;m often disappointed, when I visit some of the allegedly sophisticated schools of education, to recognize how very little of the magic and the incandescent chemistry that forms between a truly gifted teacher and her children is conveyed to those who are about to come into our classrooms. Many of these schools of education have been taken over, to a troubling degree, by people who have little knowledge of the classroom but are the technicians of a dry and mechanistic, often business-driven version of &#x201c;proficiency and productivity.&#x201d; State accountability requirements, correlated closely with the needs and wishes of the corporate community, increasingly control the ethos and the aims of education that are offered to the students at some of these schools. <br><br>But teachers, and especially the teachers of young children, are not servants of the global corporations or drill sergeants for the state and should never be compelled to view themselves that way. I think they have a higher destiny than that. The best of teachers are not merely the technicians of proficiency; they are also ministers of innocence, practitioners of tender expectations. They stalwartly refuse to see their pupils as so many future economic units for a corporate society, little pint-sized deficits or assets for America&#x2019;s economy, into whom they are expected to pump &#x201c;added value,&#x201d; as the pundits of the education policy arena now declaim. Teachers like these believe that every child who has been entrusted to their care comes into their classroom with <i>inherent</i> value to begin with. <br><br>Many of the productivity and numbers specialists who have rigidified and codified school policy in recent years do not seem to recognize much preexisting value in the young mentalities of children and, in particular, in children of the poor. Few of these people seem to be acquainted closely with the lives of children and, to be as blunt as possible about this, many would be dreadful teachers because, in my own experience at least, they tend to be rather grim-natured people who do not have lovable or interesting personalities and, frankly, would not be much fun for kids to be with. <br><br>A bullying tone often creeps into their way of speaking. A cocksure overconfidence, what Erik Erikson described as &#x201c;a destructive conscientiousness,&#x201d; is not unfamiliar too. The longer they remain within their institutes of policy or their positions in the government, the less they seem to have a vivid memory of children&#x2019;s minuscule realities, their squirmy bodies and their vulnerable temperaments, their broken pencil points, their upturned faces when the teacher comes and leans down by their desk to see why they are crying. <br><br>I suspect that you and I will come back to this matter many times. For now I simply want to say I&#x2019;m very, very glad you&#x2019;re teaching here in Boston, because that means that I can visit sometimes in your class without needing to make plans long in advance. Thank you for saying it&#x2019;s okay if I stop by one day without much prior warning, which makes things a whole lot easier for me. As you know, you&#x2019;re teaching in the neighborhood where I began to teach, so I definitely will not need to ask you for directions! <br><br>I promise to visit as soon as I can. Meanwhile, I hope the next few weeks are not too intimidating for you. You said you like your principal and that she&#x2019;s been kind to you. That&#x2019;s one big victory to start with. I&#x2019;m sure there will be many more during the weeks ahead. In spite of the butterflies you said are making &#x201c;many, many loop-the- loops&#x201d; within your stomach almost every morning as you head for school, try hard to enjoy this first month with your children if you can. <br><br>It will someday be a precious memory.<br>Chapter Two <br>Establishing the Chemistry:First Days in the Classroom <br><br>Dear Francesca, <br>You asked me how I felt the first day I ever taught in a public school. <br><br>The truthful answer is that I was terrified, even more than you were, I suspect, because I&#x2019;d had no preparation as a teacher. I had gone to Harvard College, where I was a literature major, then had studied briefly as a Rhodes Scholar in England and had lived in Paris, where I&#x2019;d studied writing in the company of older writers who were living there. <br><br>When I came back to the United States in 1964 and decided I would like to teach in public school, I knew nothing about teaching and had never had a class in education. But my lack of qualifications didn&#x2019;t seem to matter to officials in the Boston Public Schools, who were so desperate to hire almost anyone who would agree to teach in one of Boston&#x2019;s poorest neighborhoods that my application was approved without much questioning. <br><br>I found myself, within three weeks, assigned to teach a fourth grade class in Roxbury, the section of the city where the black community of Boston was confined to live, a pattern of confinement, as you&#x2019;ve noted, that exists unaltered to the present day. <br><br>My school was in a ghostly looking, badly overcrowded and physically decrepit building where my students couldn&#x2019;t even be provided with a classroom of their own. We had to share an undivided auditorium with 35 other children in another fourth grade class, and with a choral group, and sewing class (fifth grade girls, all black, were taken out of academic classes for an hour every day to learn to sew on old machines like those my grandmothers had used), and with a group rehearsing almost all fall for a Christmas play that somehow never was produced. <br><br>One windy afternoon that fall, a rotted frame of windows in our make- shift class collapsed. I was standing close enough to catch the frame before the glass could shatter on the children sitting just beneath it. <br><br>Some of the children seemed to have accepted these conditions or, at least, did not appear to feel they had the right to question them. Others did not suffer these indignities so passively but seemed to simmer with hostility toward many of the teachers and the principal. When the anger of these kids erupted, they were taken to the basement of the school, where whippings were administered by an older teacher who employed a rattan whip which he first dipped in vinegar in order to intensify the pain that it inflicted on a child&#x2019;s outstretched hands. The year before, one of the students in my class landed in the hospital after one of several whippings he&#x2019;d received. His right forefinger had been permanently distorted as a consequence. <br><br>In the spring, the principal assigned me to another fourth grade class that had a classroom of its own but was in an even worse condition than the class in which I had begun, because the children in that room had had a string of substitute teachers almost the whole year. In the course of the preceding months, twelve different teachers had appeared and disappeared. <br><br>One of the most unhappy of these teachers, an emotionally unstable person who had no experience in teaching and an oddly frenzied look in his eyes, seemed to be a kindly man, but he could not control the pent-up anger of the children. One very cold day he made the bad mistake of stepping outside on the platform of the fire escape to clap the chalk erasers. One of the children slammed the door shut while he was outside. He banged on the door and shouted warnings at the children, but they wouldn&#x2019;t let him in. A teacher, alerted by the noise, who came into the room at last, said that he was red in the face and stamping his feet&#x2014;&#x201c;like Rumpelstiltskin!&#x201d; in her words&#x2014;until she opened the door to rescue him. <br><br>That was his last day at the school. Seven additional substitute teachers came and went during the next ten days. At that point, the principal told me this would be my class for the remainder of the year. <br><br>As you can imagine, I began my first day with those children with the deepest trepidation. I knew how angry and distrustful they&#x2019;d become&#x2014; rightfully so, in view of all the damage that the school had done to them by now. But I also knew it was essential for me to suppress the self-doubts I was feeling and do something, anything I could contrive, to give the kids the confidence that a new beginning had been made. <br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t easy at the start. I literally had to shout the children down during the first few days in order to be heard. I think they were shocked by this, because I&#x2019;d worked with some of them in small groups earlier that year, and they&#x2019;d never heard me raise my voice like that before. <br><br>Once the class calmed down a bit, I sat on my desk and made a promise to the children: I told them that they would not be abandoned. I told them I was there to stay. I don&#x2019;t know why it is that they believed me. They had no reason to accept such promises from yet another teacher. I do know that, from that point on, I did my damnedest to exploit every bit of personal theatricality I had at my disposal in order to infuse that room with energy and, as best I could, with the exhilaration that might bring some smiles to the very sullen faces that had come to be their adaptation to conditions that most children, rich or poor, in any school or district would have found unbearable. <br><br>Francesca, I don&#x2019;t want you to imagine that I was immediately successful. There are too many stories about &#x201c;super-teachers&#x201d; who walk into hopeless situations and work instant miracles. Those stories make good movies but don&#x2019;t often happen in real life; and I know that, in my own case anyway, I did not work any miracles that spring. Some of the kids remained resistant to me for a long, long time, and there were two or three who never really opened up to me until the last weeks of the year. But I did discover&#x2014;and I still don&#x2019;t understand the chemistry that made this happen&#x2014;that most of the children seemed to trust me, and one reason for this, I believe, is that they could see that I did not condemn them for the chaos and confusion they&#x2019;d been through, because I told them flatly that they had been treated in a way that I thought unforgivable.</p><h2>We, the Navigators: The Ancient Art of Landfinding in the Pacific (Second Edition)</h2><p>This new edition includes a discussion of theories about traditional methods of navigation developed during recent decades, the story of the renaissance of star navigation throughout the Pacific, and material about navigation systems in Indonesia, Siberia, and the Indian Ocean.</p><p>The second edition of David Lewis&#39; classic book on Pacific navigation promises to satisfy yet again scholars and seafarers alike - and all others who have marveled at the ability of island mariners to navigate hundreds of miles of open ocean without instruments.

You and me. We&#x2019;ll be like best girlfriends.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Or double homicide victims,&#x201d; my friend Robin muttered in my ear.</p><p>Naturally, my mother, who had the ultrasonic hearing ability of a fruit bat, overheard her. &#x201c;Homicide? No, no. None of that talk.&#x201d; Leaning away from me, she whispered, &#x201c;Robin, sweetie, we mustn&#x2019;t mock Brooklyn. She can&#x2019;t help finding, you know, dead people.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mom, I don&#x2019;t think Robin meant it that way.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course she didn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Mom said, and winked at Robin.</p><p>Robin grinned at me. &#x201c;I love your mom.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I do, too,&#x201d; I said, holding back a sigh. Mom had a point, since I did have a disturbing tendency to stumble over dead bodies. She was also right to say that I couldn&#x2019;t help it. It wasn&#x2019;t like I went out in search of them, for Pete&#x2019;s sake. That would be a sickness requiring immediate intervention and possibly a twelve-step program.</p><p><i>Hello, my name is Brooklyn, and I&#x2019;m a dead-body magnet.</i></p><p>Robin&#x2019;s point was equally valid, too, though. My mother and I could come very close to destroying each other if Mom insisted on being my BFF for the next two months.</p><p>Even though she&#x2019;d raised her children in an atmosphere of peace and love and kindness, there was a limit to how much of her craziness I could take. On the other hand, Mom was an excellent cook and I could barely boil water, so I could definitely see some benefit to hanging around her house. Still, good food couldn&#x2019;t make up for the horror of living in close proximity to a woman whose latest idea of a good time was a therapeutic purging and bloodletting at the new panchakarma clinic over in Glen Ellen.</p><p>I focused on that as I poured myself another cup of coffee and added a generous dollop of half-and-half.</p><p>A few months ago, my hunky British ex&#x2013;MI6 security agent boyfriend, Derek Stone, had purchased the loft apartment next door to mine in San Francisco. We decided to blow out the walls and turn the two lofts into one big home with a spacious office for Derek and a separate living area for visiting relatives and friends. Our reliable builder had promised it would only take two months to get through the worst of the noise and mess, so Derek and I began to plan where we would stay during the renovation. I liked the idea of spending time in Dharma, where I&#x2019;d grown up, but live in my parents&#x2019; house? For two months? Even though there was plenty of room for us? Never!</p><p>&#x201c;It would be disastrous,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d concluded.</p><p>Derek&#x2019;s look of relief had been profound. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re in complete agreement as usual, darling.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Am I being awful? My parents are wonderful people.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your parents are delightful,&#x201d; he assured me, &#x201c;but we need our own space.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right. Space.&#x201d; I knew Derek was mainly concerned about me. He&#x2019;d be spending most weeks in the city and commuting to Sonoma on the weekends. His Pacific Heights office building had two luxury guest apartments on the top floor, one of which would suit him just fine.</p><p>I could&#x2019;ve stayed there with him, of course, but that would&#x2019;ve meant renting studio space at the Covington Library up the hill for my work. This would entail packing up all my bookbinding equipment and supplies, including my various book presses and a few hundred other items of importance to my job. Those small studio spaces in the Covington Library basement, while cheap, were equipped with nothing but a drafting table and two chairs, plus some empty cupboards and counters.</p><p>I&#x2019;m a bookbinder specializing in rare-book restoration, and I was currently working on several important projects that had to be delivered during the time we would be away from home. The original plan of staying with my parents, while less than ideal, would&#x2019;ve allowed me access to my former mentor&#x2019;s fully stocked bookbinding studio just down the hill from my parents. Abraham Karastovsky had died more than a year ago, but his daughter, Annie, who lived in his house now, had kept his workshop intact. She&#x2019;d also given me carte blanche to use it whenever I wanted to.</p><p>For weeks, Derek and I had tossed around various possibilities, including renting a place somewhere in the city. That seemed to be the best alternative, but at the last minute, we were given a reprieve that made everyone happy. My parents&#x2019; next-door neighbors, the Quinlans, generously offered up their gorgeous French-style cottage for our use. They were off to Europe for three months, and we were welcome to live in their home while they were gone.</p><p>We offered to pay them rent, but all they required from us was that we take good care of their golden retriever, Maggie, and water their plants. When Mom offered to take care of the plants (knowing my tendency to kill them), it was too good a deal to pass up. I was hopeful that sweet old Maggie and my adorable kitten, Charlie (aka Charlemagne Cupcake Wainwright Stone, a weighty name for something so tiny and cute), would become new best friends.</p><p>So last weekend, Derek and little Charlie and I had moved out of our South of Market Street loft and turned it over to our builder, who promised to work his magic for us.</p><p>And suddenly we were living in Dharma, next door to my parents, in a lovely two-story French-style cottage that was both elegant and comfortable. The floor of the wide foyer was paved in old, smooth brick, giving the space a natural, outdoor feeling. The spacious living room was more formal, with hardwood floors covered in thick area rugs and oversized plush furniture in browns and taupes. Rustic wrought-iron chandeliers hung from the rough-hewn beams that crisscrossed the vaulted ceiling. The sage-toned kitchen was spectacular, with a twelve-foot coffered ceiling, a pizza oven, and a wide island that provided extra space for food preparation as well as seating for six. Off the kitchen was a small library with built-in bookshelves, a wood-burning fireplace, and two overstuffed leather chairs. I could already picture the two of us sitting there reading books each night by a cozy fire.</p><p>And in every room on the ground floor, dark-wood-paneled French doors opened onto an interior patio beautifully landscaped with lush plants and flowers.</p><p>Once we were unpacked and exploring the kitchen, Derek and I watched Maggie and Charlie sniff and circle each other for a few minutes. Finally, they seemed to agree that they could live in peace together. At least, I hoped so. Maggie ambled over to her bed and settled herself down on the fluffy surface. Charlie followed right behind her, clambered up and perched directly on Maggie&#x2019;s big paw. Maggie stared at the tiny creature for a long moment, and I prepared myself to whisk the cat away. But then Maggie let out a heavy sigh and closed her eyes. Charlie snuggled up against the big dog&#x2019;s soft, warm fur and was asleep several seconds later.</p><p>Derek and I exchanged smiles. I had a feeling we would all be very happy here.</p><p>And now here I was, sitting in my mother&#x2019;s kitchen on a bright Monday morning, drinking coffee with Robin and listening as my mother tried to brush past the fact that I did indeed have an alarming tendency to come upon dead bodies in the strangest places. Luckily, that wasn&#x2019;t likely to happen in Dharma anytime soon.</p><p>As I watched Mom bustle around her sunny kitchen, I wondered how I&#x2019;d ever thought I could avoid seeing her every day simply because we weren&#x2019;t together in the same house. Not that I minded visiting with her on a regular basis. I joked about it, of course, but in truth, my mother was great, a true original and a sweet, funny woman with a good heart. All my friends loved her. She was smart and generous. But sometimes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, I worried about her hobbies. She&#x2019;d been heavily involved in Wicca for a while and recently had been anointed Grand Raven Mistress of her local druidic coven. Some of the spells she had cast had been alarmingly effective. She would try anything once. Lately she&#x2019;d shown some interest in exorcisms. I didn&#x2019;t know what to expect.</p><p>I supposed I didn&#x2019;t have much room to criticize Mom&#x2019;s hobbies, given that my own seemed to revolve around crime scenes.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you want some breakfast before we leave?&#x201d; I asked Robin. We&#x2019;d made plans to drive over to the winery this morning to watch them excavate the existing storage cave over by the cabernet vineyards. It would eventually become a large underground tasting room. Cave tastings were the hottest trend in Napa and Sonoma, and our popular Dharma winery was finally jumping on the bandwagon.</p><p>Robin pulled out a kitchen chair and sat. &#x201c;I already had breakfast with Austin. He had to be on-site at seven.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Derek left the house about that time, too. I thought he&#x2019;d be driving into the city today, but he decided to hang around to watch the excavation.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Austin was so excited, he could barely sleep last night.&#x201d; Robin lived with my brother Austin, with whom she had been in love since third grade. She and I had been best friends since then, too, and I loved her as much as any of my three sisters. I didn&#x2019;t get to see her as often as I used to when she was living in San Francisco, but I knew she was blissfully happy with Austin, who supported her sculpting work and was clearly as much in love with her as she was with him.</p><p>Austin ran the Dharma winery, and my brother Jackson managed the vineyards. My father did a great job of overseeing the entire operation, thanks to his early experience in the business world. Decades ago he&#x2019;d turned his back on corporate hell and gone off to follow the Grateful Dead. Ironically, these days, Dad and four other commune members made up the winery&#x2019;s board of directors. He was also part of the town council, but this time around he loved all of that business stuff. It probably helped that Dad had always been remarkably laid-back and still was. I sometimes wondered if Mom had cast a mellow spell on him.</p><p>I checked the kitchen clock. It was already seven thirty. The cave excavation was scheduled to begin at eight. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll just fix myself a quick bowl of cereal, and then we&#x2019;ll go.&#x201d;</p><p>Robin glanced at Mom. &#x201c;Becky, are you coming with us?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You girls go on ahead,&#x201d; she said, pulling a large plastic bin of homemade granola down from the cupboard. &#x201c;I want to put together a basket of herbs and goodies for the cave ceremony. I&#x2019;ll catch up with you later.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What cave ceremony?&#x201d; I asked as I poured granola into a bowl and returned the bin to the cupboard.</p><p>She looked at me as though I&#x2019;d failed my third-grade spelling test. &#x201c;Sweetie, we have to bless the new space.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; I shot Robin a wary glance. &#x201c;Of course we do.&#x201d;</p><p>Robin bumped my shoulder. &#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t been away so long that you&#x2019;d forget about the sacred cave ceremony.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been busy,&#x201d; I mumbled. She was teasing me, but still, I should&#x2019;ve known that my mother would want to cast a protection spell or a celebration spell to commemorate the groundbreaking of our winery&#x2019;s newest venture.</p><p>I could picture Mom doing a spritely interpretive dance to the wine goddess. She would chant bad haiku and sprinkle magic sparkles on the heavy tunneling machines and equipment. It would be amazing, and the heavy equipment would turn our dark storage cave into a large, magical wine-tasting space where all would be welcome.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, sweetie,&#x201d; Mom said, hanging a dish towel on the small rack by the sink. &#x201c;While you&#x2019;re here, you should go to lunch at the new vegan restaurant on the Lane. They serve a turnip burger that is to die for.&#x201d;</p><p>I swallowed cautiously, hoping I didn&#x2019;t lose my breakfast. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be sure to check that out, Mom.&#x201d;</p><p>She glanced at me and laughed. &#x201c;Oh, you should see your face. Do you really think I&#x2019;d be caught dead eating something so vile?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Okay, you got me.&#x201d; I shook my head and chuckled as I carried my bowl to the sink. &#x201c;I was trying to remember when you turned vegan.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I tried it once for a day and a half and vowed never again. And even then, did I ever serve my children turnips? No, never.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right and I appreciate it. But I haven&#x2019;t seen you in a while. I was afraid maybe you&#x2019;d turned into Savannah.&#x201d; My sister Savannah was a vegetarian now, but she&#x2019;d gone through several austere phases to get there, including a few months when she would only eat fruit that had already fallen from the tree.</p><p>&#x201c;No, I was just pulling your leg.&#x201d;</p><p>I smiled at her. &#x201c;You still got it, Mom.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I sure do.&#x201d; She grabbed me in another hug, and it felt good to hold on to her. &#x201c;Oh, Brooklyn, I&#x2019;m so happy you&#x2019;re here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So am I.&#x201d;</p><p>She gave me one last squeeze, then let me go. As I washed out my cereal bowl, she left the kitchen.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get going,&#x201d; Robin said after I put my bowl away in the cupboard. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to miss anything.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wait a second, girls,&#x201d; my mother called from her office alcove off the kitchen. She walked out, holding two tiny muslin bags tied with drawstrings, and handed one to each of us. &#x201c;I want you both to carry one of these in your pocket,&#x201d; she said, her expression deadly serious. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll keep you safe.&#x201d;</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>&#x201c;That is the coolest, scariest piece of equipment I&#x2019;ve ever seen,&#x201d; Robin said.</p><p>I had to agree. We both stared at the monstrous excavation machine that was parked at the mouth of the storage cave, waiting to roll into action. They called it a roadheader, and it was huge, weighing more than sixty tons (I&#x2019;d overheard Dad gushing about its weight to Derek while they were standing around having a manly conversation about heavy equipment), and was as large as the biggest bulldozer I&#x2019;d ever seen.</p><p>Extending at least fifteen feet out in front of its tanklike body was a medieval-looking articulated arm, or boom, at the tip of which was a large steel ball covered in clawlike spikes. As the machine rumbled forward, the ball rotated fast enough to tear its way through hard rock, slowly creating a tunnel. That was the theory, anyway. It hadn&#x2019;t started working yet. When it did, there would be dust and noise and, possibly, earthquakelike shaking. It would all be worth it when the tasting cave was completed. I could barely wait for that day.</p><p>It had always made sense to use caves for wine-barrel storage. Sonoma tended to get hot in the summer, and underground storage was the cheapest and most efficient way to maintain a constant temperature, which was vital to the health of the wine.</p><p>But over the past few years, many of the local wineries had expanded on the idea and had brought the actual wine-tasting experience into the caves. I&#x2019;d done a tour of some of the tasting caves in the area, and they were beautiful, unique spaces. Some were rustic; others were elegant. One low-ceilinged, tunnel-like cave I&#x2019;d visited in Napa had been excavated by hand during the days of the gold rush. You could still see the uneven spike marks on the dark stone walls made by the workers&#x2019; hammers and pickaxes.</p><p>Several wineries in the area had built luxurious private dining rooms within their caves. Another offered a complete spa experience. There were waterfalls and unusual lighting and nooks and crannies to explore. One local tasting cave featured an und...</p></p><h2>Nightwing Vol. 3: Death of the Family (The New 52)</h2><p>After having his face sliced off one year ago, the Joker makes his horrifying return to Gotham City!

An ambitious marketing operation, it could not afford to take chances on haute couture; its fashions were geared as closely as possible to the prevailing tastes of the American people. <br>For this historically accurate sampling of authentic 1930s fashion, Stella Blum, former Curator of the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, selected for reproduction 133 representative pages from rare Sears catalogs of the period (fall and spring catalog for each year from 1930 to 1939). Hundreds of illustrations record what men, women, and children were actually wearing in the 1930s when, as a copyline from the Fall 1930 catalog proclaimed: "Thrift is the spirit of the day. Reckless spending is a thing of the past."<br>You'll see here how simpler women's fashion designs &#x2014; of more traditional, affordable material &#x2014; recaptured the feminine form with a more natural waistline and lower hemlines than seen in the twenties. For evening wear, longer dresses replaced flamboyant beaded short gowns while cloche hats, another twenties trademark, were replaced by berets, pillboxes, and turbans. The seriousness of the accessories and dresses endorsed by such Hollywood legends as Loretta Young, Claudette Colbert, and Fay Wray.<br>For historians of costume, nostalgia buffs and casual browsers, these pages afford a rare picture of how the average American really dressed during the thirties. It is an essential resource for study of the clothing of an important era which designers cannot afford to be without.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Joy for Beginners</h2><p><b><b>&#x201c;<i>Joy for Beginners</i> takes us on the emotional journeys of seven women seeking to transform their lives, and proves that sometimes what we really need to inspire us to change is a good, firm shove.&#x201d;&#x2014;Garth Stein, author of <i>The Art of Racing in the Rain</i></b><br><br></b>Having survived a life-threatening illness, Kate celebrates by gathering with six close friends.

There was something so bold and liberating in her declaration, especially as it came from someone who is actually quite shy. I loved the audacity of it, the courage behind it, and it gave me the idea for a book. In the end, a group of seven women characters showed up in my imagination, ranging in age and personality and facing an equally eclectic group of challenges, but that first idea of reaching beyond what is comfortable remained the same. </p> <p> <b>Q:</b> When you gave readings from your previous book, <em>The School of Essential Ingredients</em>, you sometimes mentioned the idea for this new novel, and received a strong reaction from the women in your audiences. What did they say? </p> <p> <b>A:</b> I think many of us want to stretch ourselves&#x2014;try something new, face a fear, break out of a role or a rut we have fallen into. Sometimes we just need an excuse (or a good, firm shove) to get ourselves to do it. I see <em>Joy for Beginners</em> providing that inspiration, by showing readers ordinary, complicated people pushing themselves into new and different territories. I&#x2019;ve talked with several book clubs that have decided to read the book and do their own set of challenges at the same time, and I think that&#x2019;s a wonderful idea. </p> <p> <b>Q:</b> The mysterious power of food to heal and to bring people back to their essential selves was a central theme of your first book. Your new book is not focused on food, yet you see a strong connection between the two books. What is it? </p> <p> <b>A:</b> As with <em>The School of Essential Ingredients</em>&#x2014;where the focus was food but the point was all the emotional and mental revelations that occurred before, during and because of cooking&#x2014;the emotional center of <em>Joy for Beginners</em> lies in what the women learn through their challenges, even more than the challenges themselves. As a result, the challenges range from the overtly and physically demanding to ones that might seem simple on the surface. As I was writing, I was thinking&#x2014;what are we truly afraid of? For some, it might mean climbing a mountain or sky diving, but my guess is that for many people fear is often contained within something far less obvious. As Eudora Welty said: &#x201c;all serious daring starts from within.&#x201d; </p> <p> <b>Q:</b> Your books are in many ways a celebration of the senses. Why is there such a strong emphasis on the senses in your work? </p> <p> <b>A:</b> I think our senses are one of the greatest gifts we have been given, and that our lives only become richer by paying attention to them. Most of us spend so much of our days facing a screen &#x2013; computer, phone or television. What a delight to remember that we live in bodies with fingers that touch and tongues that taste and noses that have the power to take us, with one inhalation, back in time or into the presence of someone we once loved. </p> <p> <b>Q:</b> Which of your characters are you most like? </p> <p> <b>A:</b> I get asked that question a lot. The truth, as I think is the same for many authors, is that they are all me and none of them are me. I made a promise to myself a long time ago that I wouldn&#x2019;t write any character that I couldn&#x2019;t feel empathy with&#x2014;which meant I had to get into their heads and understand how they thought. What surprised me was that it was often the characters that were least like me who really surprised me into empathy. </p> <p> Photo of Erica Bauermeister � Susan Doupe </p><b>Erica Bauermeister</b>&nbsp;is the national bestselling author of the <i>The</i>&nbsp;<i>School of Essential Ingredients</i>, <i>The Lost Art of Mixing</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Joy for Beginners</i>.

Always looking for a way to increase the church's profit margins, Hinshaw brainstorms a progressive nativity scene that will involve the whole town, complete with a map like those for the Hollywood stars. Neither Pastor Sam Gardner nor the other members of the Harmony Friends meeting express any enthusiasm for this idea, but Dale is unstoppable. Meanwhile, Pastor Sam has his own concerns: he's having his annual argument with his wife, and he's worried that the four-slotted toaster he bought for her may be too lavish a gift.</p><p>Amidst the bustle of the season, the citizens of Harmony experience the simple joys and sometime loneliness that often go unseen. Sam comes to the realization that Dale, in his own misguided way, is only trying to draw meaning from the eternal story of Christmas. "In this unsettled world, it is good to have this steadiness -- the Christmas Eve service, the peal of the bell. . . .There is a holiness to memory, a sense of God's presence in these mangers of the mind. Which might explain why it is that the occasions that change the least are often the very occasions that change us the most."</p></p><p><p>Philip Gulley is a Quaker minister, writer, husband, and father. He is the bestselling author of <em>Front Porch Tales</em>, the acclaimed Harmony series, and is coauthor of <em>If Grace Is True</em> and <em>If God Is Love</em>. Gulley lives with his wife and two sons in Indiana, and is a frequent speaker at churches, colleges, and retreat centers across the country.</p>Gulley's beloved Harmony series takes a festive turn with this delightful novella, featuring Quaker minister Sam Gardner and the intimate circle of eccentrics who comprise his congregation. The infuriating church elder Dale Hinshaw is up to his usual schemes, this time planning an all-out "progressive nativity scene" on Christmas Eve that will convert the heathen while turning a tidy profit for the church. Gulley's trademark humor is much in evidence, as when he muses on the irony that Dale wants to raise a "Quaker militia" to forfend any terrorist activity on Christmas Eve, or describes how the church's Christmas card list gets longer every year because even one-time visitors who drop a small check in the collection plate gain "a place in our directory in perpetuity." More extraordinary than the jesting, however, is Gulley's theological sensitivity and often profound reflections on parenting, traditions and the Christian story.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Black Spring</h2><p>Continuing the subversive self-revelation begun in Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn, Henry Miller takes readers along a mad, free-associating journey from the damp grime of his Brooklyn youth to the sun-splashed cafes and squalid flats of Paris.

At the core of Impossible Cure is the amazing story of how the author&#39;s son was cured of autism with homeopathy. It also includes dozens of other testimonials of homeopathic cure, for a variety of physical, mental, and emotional conditions. Impossible Cure will serve as an invaluable guide to anyone interested in learning more about this intriguing form of health care. It has won endorsements from leading experts in alternative health care, including: Larry Dossey, MD (executive editor, Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine, and author of Healing Words); Bernard Rimland, PhD (director, Autism Research Institute); Wayne Jonas, MD (director, Samueli Institute, and former director, Office of Alternative Medicine, NIH); Michael Castleman (author of The New Healing Herbs and other consumer health books); Louis Klein, RSHom (president, Luminos Homeopathic Courses); and Richard Pitt, CCH, RSHom(NA) (director, Pacific Academy of Homeopathy).</p><p>Amy Lansky graduated from the University of Rochester in 1977 with degrees in mathematics and computer science. She received her doctorate in computer science from Stanford University in 1983. After many years working at various Silicon Valley research institutions, Lansky made an unusual career move -- she became a student, writer, and promoter of homeopathic medicine. This was prompted by the miraculous cure of her son&#39;s autism with homeopathy. She serves on the board of the National Center for Homeopathy and has been active in the national health freedom movement. She is dedicated to helping others -- especially families with autistic children -- discover the curative powers of homeopathy.Dr. Joseph Mercola: In Impossible Cure: The Promise of Homeopathy, author Amy Lansky tells the incredible story of how homeopathy was used to cure her son of autism. Although Lansky is not a medical professional, she has a Ph.D. from Stanford and worked for NASA as a researcher. She has more than enough scientific training to provide a compelling and easy to understand description of how homeopathy can be used to treat 'incurable conditions' like autism. Along with this compelling testimonial, Lansky provides an in-depth account on the history, philosophy and practice of homeopathy, as well as dozens of other testimonials on the power of homeopathy in curing various health problems... Impossible Cure covers all aspects of homeopathy from how it was developed to supporting research available today, including a guide to current homeopathic resources, and interweaves fact with the personal experiences of many people. The result is an introduction to homeopathy that stands out from the rest and is appropriate for anyone interested in homeopathy, whether they are at the beginner or professional level. There is also an entire chapter devoted to reviewing the scientific evidence supporting the validity of homeopathy. This chapter should help reassure skeptics. Also useful is Lansky's use of sound evidence and personal insight to share her unique perspective on why homeopathy is a worthy alternative to traditional medicine. After two decades working as a computer scientist, Lansky was so moved by her son's healing that she left her career to become an advocate and practitioner of homeopathic medicine. Her enthusiasm, belief and knowledge in homeopathy comes through in her writing and serves as an important guide on how and why homeopathy is a truly effective way to overcome chronic disease and restore mental, emotional and physical health. --Review, Mercola Newsletter<br><br>Impossible Cure is the finest general introduction to homeopathy I've yet read... Lansky's writing is magnificently crafted, and all her facts and figures are as straight as can be. She weaves together a seamless exposition about homeopathy -- what it is, how it developed, what research exists, and with it gives us her personal journey of discovery... I have a goodly number of 'homeopathic introductions' in my library. Many are just rehashes of the same old stuff. A few really do step out and present the material in a new way. This book takes the furthest step -- in part because it is the most recent and can draw upon the latest thinking and research -- but also because the author drew on the experiences of many people to help her and coupled that with her excellence as a word crafter. This book should be read by everyone interested in homeopathy, from the rank beginner to the seasoned professional. It has something new in it for everyone-- no matter which level they are on... Bravo for Amy for having the vision to see it and the skill to make it happen. --Julian Winston, Editor of Homeopathy Today, Author: The Faces of Homeopathy<br><br>This new book is one of the clearest and most comprehensive introductions to homeopathy in recent times. In Impossible Cure, Amy Lansky, PhD, explains in a remarkably reader-friendly way the science and art of homeopathy. By including dozens of patients' stories as well as interviews with practitioners, she weaves a well-crafted overview. Her language is not complex, making it accessible to the non-technical reader. This book may very well contribute to the transformation of homeopathy from the ugly duckling of medicine to the swan that it deserves to be. The book is written from two vantage points: that of a loving mother sharing the heart-wrenching story of her son's struggle with autism and how homeopathy cured him, and that of a skeptic delving into the mysteries of healing... Lansky shares the story of how her son, Max, recovered fully from moderate autism...[This] is followed by chapters that delve into deep issues, such as, 'What is Disease? What is Cure?' Lansky acquaints the reader with the relationship between the symptom pattern and the simillimum. She presents a historical picture of the development of the varied strategies homeopaths may use when they choose a remedy and its potency. LM potency use is included, so the book joins just a handful of others modern enough to speak of this relatively new phenomenon. Lansky gives a short explanation of related applications of homeopathy outside the classical homeopathic paradigm, including combination remedies, isopathy, anthroposophic medicines, homeopathic prophylaxis, homeopathic specifics, cell salts, intuitive and machine-generated prescribing, Flower Essences, herbalism, and energy healing. Lansky states here that it is 'important for patients to understand which treatment methods are actually 'homeopathy' and which are not.' Impossible Cure also includes up-to-date information on homeopathic research and its significance in relation to modern medicine. The author's skill at word crafting is noticeable here- - whereas other books' descriptions of chaos theory, ultra dilutions, and cluster physics had lost me, this book has actually made these complex theories understandable to my brain - no small feat! Lansky guides fledgling consumers through finding a practitioner, experiencing an initial interview, taking a remedy, and responding to it. This is a great help to someone who has no idea what to expect when stepping into homeopathy. The chapter, 'Cure is Possible' relates many success stories drawn from an impressive, international list of practitioners, patients, and their family members - including dramatic reversals of Alzheimer's disease, cancer, fibromyalgia, and mental illness. These are instructive cases illustrating the efficacy of homeopathy. Impossible Cure sticks to principles and philosophy, completely foregoing any discussion of materia medica and how-to information. Since most people, even in enlightened circles, still do not understand homeopathy and its potential, the homeopathic community is faced with the challenge of getting the word out - and the even larger challenge of providing accessible, affordable, professional, homeopathic health care - thereby liberating society from the monopoly of conventional medical care. Homeopathy must grow into a viable healthcare choice for the many - not just for an elite few - and this will take massive education at the grassroots and a shift in how homeopathy is now accessed. Impossible Cure succeeds in demystifying homeopathy's approach to healing and will help people understand what embarking on homeopathic treatment is all about. The facts and history are accurate and well-documented. Everyone interested in homeopathy can enjoy this book, from the rank beginner to the seasoned homeopath. The book speaks of the promise that homeopathy holds for those who step forward to use it. --Lia Bello, Reviewer for Homeopathy Today</p><h2>Lift-the-Flap Tab: Tractor Mac: Friends on the Farm (Lift-the-Flap Tab Books)</h2><p><p>Oh no, Carla the Chicken has lost her ten chicks!

Recipes cover all the basics, from pie crust to funnel cake to cheese souffle. The book also contains appendices and equipment lists.</p><p>Alton Brown's <i>I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking</i> should be required reading for those who truly want to learn how to become great bakers. In his own off-beat style Alton explains the science behind the process simply and in a manner you will not only remember, but subconsciously apply to all your baking endeavors. What is salt's role in the baking process? Why use eggs? Why is the way you mix important to overall success? Stylized and presented like his first book and popular Food Network show <i>Good Eats</i>, <i>Baking</i> is more like a goofy textbook rather then a pretty, photographed book with a bunch of recipes. If you are looking for a couple of quick, simple recipes to make cookies or bread, keep looking. If it's an education about the "Whats," "Whys," and "Hows" of baking with the intent to lift your skills to a new level: welcome! <p> Baking is a precise science that needs to be followed to the letter if you want success. It is highly recommended to read the introduction and "The Parts Department" section before attempting any of the recipes in this book. The essence of Alton Brown's book is not to simply follow recipes, but to get a deep understanding of what is going on during the baking process. The introduction goes over the layout of the book and how it should be used (the ingenious "method flaps" for instance), the low down on how to read recipes, the importance of measuring by weight vs. volume, and baking's five core steps. The "Parts" section explains just that: ingredients. What is the chemical make up of proteins, carbs, and fats? Why is their interrelationship so important to success? How well do you know flour, eggs, sugar, and baking soda? Once you have the basics down and your parts measured it's time to get mixing. The rest of the book is smartly broken up by the six major mixing methods (Muffin, Biscuit, Creaming, Straight Dough, Egg Foam, and Custards). Each technique is explored in detail with recipes to follow. You won't find any ultra fancy recipes in <i>Baking</i>. The focus here is on the basics and getting the basics down right. Rediscover some old favorites like chocolate cookies and muffins, buttermilk pancakes, biscuits, shortcake, multigrain loaf bread, and good old fashioned cheesecake. There is no denying it, follow Alton's advice and you will be a better baker. Guaranteed. <i>--Rob Bracco</i></p>Alton Brown is the writer, director, and host of the Food Network show <i>Good Eats,</i> which won a 2007 Peabody Award, and is the expert commentator on <i>Iron Chef America</i>.

How did the master builders from the stars construct the miracle called man? Is the DNA that is at the core of all life in the universe a "cosmic code" that links Earth to heaven and man to God?</p><p>In this sixth volume of <em>The Earth Chronicles</em>, Zecharia Sitchin unveils writings from the past to decipher prophesies, and reveals how the DNA-matched Hebrew alphabet and the numerical values of its letters serve as a code that bares the secrets of mortal man&#x2019;s fate and mankind&#x2019;s celestial destiny.</p></p><p>One of the charms of Zecharia Sitchin is his tendency to take ancient writings as fact as opposed to myth. For example, according to clay tablets discovered by archeologists, Gilgamesh, a king of ancient Sumeria, was punished by the gods for raping female subjects on their wedding day--a particularly naughty, though not uncommon, pastime of ancient royalty. Snickering, the tricky gods created a double of him, which, as you can imagine, created havoc in the king's life. Some time later, directed by his goddess mother, Gilgamesh walked with his double to Lebanon to attain immortality. Sitchin ponders that perhaps the double had superhuman strength and en route built a second Stonehenge discovered in the Golan Heights by Israelis during the 1967 Six Days War. Hmmm. As Sitchin concedes, there's really no way to tell who actually built this hoary structure, but the in-depth archeological and historical research gathered here to support his musings concerning an extraterrestrial secret code to construct humankind is fascinating beyond belief. <i>--P. Randall Cohan</i>Dear Reader, <br> <br><em>The Earth Chronicles</em> series is based on the premise that mythology is the depository of ancient recollections, that the Bible should be read literally as a historic-scientific document, and that ancient civilizations were the product of knowledge brought to Earth by the Anunnaki--&#x201c;Those who from Heaven to Earth came.&#x201d; <br> <br>Complementing each other and serving to bring the saga of gods and humans on Earth ever closer to our time, each book of the series looks at this awesome tale from a different perspective. <br> <br><em>The 12th Planet</em>, the first book of the series, brings to life the Sumerian civilization and presents millennia-old evidence of the existence of Nibiru, the home planet of the Anunnaki, and the landings of the Anunnaki on Earth every 3,600 years. <br> <br><em>The Stairway to Heaven</em>, the second book, incorporates ancient Egyptian evidence to show that the gateway between the mortal and the divine was a spaceport in the Sinai Peninsula, with the Giza pyramids and the Sphinx serving as beacons for the landings. <br> <br><em>The Wars of Gods and Men</em>, the third book, additionally embraces Canaanite, Hittite, and Hindu sources to include in these investigations the incidents of the Tower of Babel and the upheaval of Sodom and Gomorrah, concluding that nuclear weapons were used on Earth 4,000 years ago. <br> <br><em>The Lost Realms</em>, the fourth book, transports readers to the pre-Columbian civilizations and ancient empires of the Americas, revealing hitherto unrecognized golden links between ancient Near Eastern civilizations and the &#x201c;cities of the gods&#x201d; of the Olmecs, Mayas, Aztecs, and Incas. <br> <br><em>When Time Began</em>, the fifth book, explores ancient knowledge of Heaven and Earth and the interwoven cycles that gave rise to astronomy, the zodiac and astrology, and stone calendars such as Stonehenge, revealing the secret of New Ages past and future. <br> <br>And <em>The Cosmic Code</em>, the sixth book in the series, explains how the secrets of humankind&#x2019;s celestial teachers were encoded in the Bible and other sacred and hidden &#x201c;books&#x201d;--a cosmic code that links Earthlings to their cosmic roots. <br> <br>In the years since each book was published, new scientific discoveries have provided mounting corroboration of the series&#x2019; incredible and unorthodox science-based conclusions.

His approach is especially helpful to people who get "stuck" or blocked in their writing, and is equally useful for writing fiction, poetry, and essays, as well as reports, lectures, and memos.<br> The core of Elbow's thinking is a challenge against traditional writing methods. Instead of editing and outlining material in the initial steps of the writing process, Elbow celebrates non-stop or free uncensored writing, without editorial checkpoints first, followed much later by the editorial process. This approach turns the focus towards encouraging ways of developing confidence and inspiration through free writing, multiple drafts, diaries, and notes. Elbow guides the reader through his metaphor of writing as "cooking:" his term for heating up the creative process where the subconscious bubbles up to the surface and the writing gets good.<br> 1998 marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of <em>Writing Without Teachers</em>. In this edition, Elbow reexamines his program and the subsequent influence his techniques have had on writers, students, and teachers. This invaluable guide will benefit anyone, whether in the classroom, boardroom, or living room, who has ever had trouble writing.<br></p><p>If Peter Elbow's <i>Writing Without Teachers</i> seems to have come into being at the same time as '70s encounter groups, that's because it did. First published in 1976, <i>Writing Without Teachers</i> advocates improving your writing via freewriting and the "teacherless writing class." Freewriting, according to Elbow, is a terrific way to get things onto the page that you never knew you had in you: "Never stop ... to wonder what word or thought to use, or to think about what you are doing." Only after you have finished writing should you contemplate editing. And though much of what you produce when freewriting will be real garbage, Elbow promises that the best parts will be far better than anything you could have written otherwise. "You will use up more paper," he warns, "but chew up fewer pencils."<p> The teacherless writing class is Elbow's other key to unlocking the writer within. Elbow prefers these groups to those with teachers, because a teacher, he says, "usually isn't in a position where he can be genuinely affected by your words." In a teacherless group, the other participants "give you better evidence of what is unclear in your writing." Elbow insists that members of a writing group disregard conventional theories of "good" and "bad" writing, urging instead that they react to one another's work in a more subjective manner. The ultimate goal, he says, is for the group process to help each writer improve his or her ability to decide "which parts of [his or her] own writing to keep and which to throw away." <i>--Jane Steinberg</i></p><br><strong>Peter Elbow</strong> is Professor of English and Director of the writing program at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.<br></p><h2>Queen Unseen: My Life with the Greatest Rock Band of the 20th Century</h2><p><p>For more than a decade, Peter Hince worked alongside one of the greatest bands in the history of rock, touring the world and&nbsp;heading up their road crew.

Originally published in 1924 and long out of print, these tales are vintage Wharton, dealing boldly with such themes as infidelity, illegitimacy, jealousy, the class system, and the condition of women in society. Included in this remarkable quartet are <i>False Dawn,</i> which concerns the stormy relationship between a domineering father and his son; <i>The Old Maid,</i> the best known of the four, in which a young woman's secret illegitimate child is adopted by her best friend -- with devastating results; <i>The Spark,</i> about a young man's moral rehabilitation, which is "sparked" by a chance encounter with Walt Whitman; and <i>New Year's Day,</i> an O. Henryesque tale of a married woman suspected of adultery. <i>Old New York</i> is Wharton at her finest.</p><p>Edith Wharton&nbsp;(1862&#x2013;1937) was an American novelist&#x2014;the first woman to win a Pulitzer Prize for her novel&nbsp;<i>The Age of Innocence&nbsp;</i>in 1921&#x2014;as well as a short story writer, playwright, designer, reporter, and poet. Born into one of New York's elite families, she drew upon her knowledge of upper class aristocracy to realistically portray the lives and morals of the Gilded Age.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br>Hay, verbena and mignonette scented the languid July day. Large strawberries, crimsoning through sprigs of mint, floated in a bowl of pale yellow cup on the verandah table: an old Georgian bowl, with complex reflections on polygonal flanks, engraved with the Raycie arms between lion's heads. Now and again the gentlemen, warned by a menacing hum, slapped their cheeks, their brows or their bald crowns; but they did so as furtively as possible, for Mr. Halston Raycie, on whose verandah they sat, would not admit that there were mosquitoes at High Point.<br><br>The strawberries came from Mr. Raycie's kitchen garden; the Georgian bowl came from his great-grandfather (father of the Signer); the verandah was that of his country-house, which stood on a height above the Sound, at a convenient driving distance from his town house in Canal Street.<br><br>"Another glass, Commodore," said Mr. Raycie, shaking out a cambric handkerchief the size of a table-cloth, and applying a corner of it to his steaming brow.<br><br>Mr. Jameson Ledgely smiled and took another glass. He was known as "the Commodore" among his intimates because of having been in the Navy in his youth, and having taken part, as a midshipman under Admiral Porter, in the war of 1812. This jolly sunburnt bachelor, whose face resembled that of one of the bronze idols he might have brought back with him, had kept his naval air, though long retired from the service; and his white duck trousers, his gold-braided cap and shining teeth, still made him look as if he might be in command of a frigate. Instead of that, he had just sailed over a party of friends from his own place on the Long Island shore; and his trim white sloop was now lying in the bay below the point.<br><br>The Halston Raycie house overlooked a lawn sloping to the Sound. The lawn was Mr. Raycie's pride: it was mown with a scythe once a fortnight, and rolled in the spring by an old white horse specially shod for the purpose. Below the verandah the turf was broken by three rounds of rose-geranium, heliotrope and Bengal roses, which Mrs. Raycie tended in gauntlet gloves, under a small hinged sunshade that folded back on its carved ivory handle. The house, remodelled and enlarged by Mr. Raycie on his marriage, had played a part in the Revolutionary war as the settler's cottage where Benedict Arnold had had his headquarters. A contemporary print of it hung in Mr. Raycie's study; but no one could have detected the humble outline of the old house in the majestic stone-coloured dwelling built of tongued-and-grooved boards, with an angle tower, tall narrow windows, and a verandah on chamfered posts, that figured so confidently as a "Tuscan Villa" in Downing's "Landscape Gardening in America." There was the same difference between the rude lithograph of the earlier house and the fine steel en-graving of its successor (with a "specimen" weeping beech on the lawn) as between the buildings themselves. Mr. Raycie had reason to think well of his architect.<br><br>He thought well of most things related to himself by ties of blood or interest. No one had ever been quite sure that he made Mrs. Raycie happy, but he was known to have the highest opinion of her. So it was with his daughters, Sarah Anne and Mary Adeline, fresher replicas of the lymphatic Mrs. Raycie; no one would have sworn that they were quite at ease with their genial parent, yet every one knew how loud he was in their praises. But the most remarkable object within the range of Mr. Raycie's self-approval was his son Lewis. And yet, as Jameson Ledgely, who was given to speaking his mind, had once observed, you wouldn't have supposed young Lewis was exactly the kind of craft Halston would have turned out if he'd had the designing of his son and heir.<br><br>Mr. Raycie was a monumental man. His extent in height, width and thickness was so nearly the same that whichever way he was turned one had an almost equally broad view of him; and every inch of that mighty circumference was so exquisitely cared for that to a farmer's eye he might have suggested a great agricultural estate of which not an acre is untilled. Even his baldness, which was in proportion to the rest, looked as if it received a special daily polish; and on a hot day his whole person was like some wonderful example of the costliest irrigation. There was so much of him, and he had so many planes, that it was fascinating to watch each runnel of moisture follow its own particular watershed. Even on his large fresh-looking hands the drops divided, trickling in different ways from the ridges of the fingers; and as for his forehead and temples, and the raised cushion of cheek beneath each of his lower lids, every one of these slopes had its own particular stream, its hollow pools and sudden cataracts; and the sight was never unpleasant, because his whole vast bubbling surface was of such a clean and hearty pink, and the exuding moisture so perceptibly flavoured with expensive eau de Cologne and the best French soap.<br><br>Mrs. Raycie, though built on a less heroic scale, had a pale amplitude which, when she put on her best watered silk (the kind that stood alone), and framed her countenance in the innumerable blonde lace ruffles and clustered purple grapes of her newest Paris cap, almost balanced her husband's bulk. Yet from this full-rigged pair, as the Commodore would have put it, had issued the lean little runt of a Lewis, a shrimp of a baby, a shaver of a boy, and now a youth as scant as an ordinary man's midday shadow.<br><br>All these things, Lewis himself mused, dangling his legs from the verandah rail, were undoubtedly passing through the minds of the four gentlemen grouped about his father's bowl of cup.<br><br>Mr. Robert Huzzard, the banker, a tall broad man, who looked big in any company but Mr. Raycie's, leaned back, lifted his glass, and bowed to Lewis.<br><br>"Here's to the Grand Tour!"<br><br>"Don't perch on that rail like a sparrow, my boy," Mr. Raycie said reprovingly; and Lewis dropped to his feet, and returned Mr. Huzzard's bow.<br><br>"I wasn't thinking," he stammered. It was his too frequent excuse.<br><br>Mr. Ambrose Huzzard, the banker's younger brother, Mr. Ledgely and Mr. Donaldson Kent, all raised their glasses and cheerily echoed: "The Grand Tour!"<br><br>Lewis bowed again, and put his lips to the glass he had forgotten. In reality, he had eyes only for Mr. Donaldson Kent, his father's cousin, a silent man with a lean hawk-like profile, who looked like a retired Revolutionary hero, and lived in daily fear of the most trifling risk or responsibility.<br><br>To this prudent and circumspect citizen had come, some years earlier, the unexpected and altogether inexcusable demand that he should look after the daughter of his only brother, Julius Kent. Julius had died in Italy -- well, that was his own business, if he chose to live there. But to let his wife die before him, and to leave a minor daughter, and a will entrusting her to the guardianship of his esteemed elder brother, Donaldson Kent Esquire, of Kent's Point, Long Island, and Great Jones Street, New York -- well, as Mr. Kent himself said, and as his wife said for him, there had never been anything, anything whatever, in Mr. Kent's attitude or behaviour, to justify the ungrateful Julius (whose debts he had more than once paid) in laying on him this final burden.<br><br>The girl came. She was fourteen, she was considered plain, she was small and black and skinny. Her name was Beatrice, which was bad enough, and made worse by the fact that it had been shortened by ignorant foreigners to Treeshy. But she was eager, serviceable and good-tempered, and as Mr. and Mrs. Kent's friends pointed out, her plainness made everything easy. There were two Kent boys growing up, Bill and Donald; and if this penniless cousin had been compounded of cream and roses -- well, she would have taken more watching, and might have rewarded the kindness of her uncle and aunt by some act of wicked ingratitude. But this risk being obviated by her appearance, they could be goodnatured to her without afterthought, and to be goodnatured was natural to them. So, as the years passed, she gradually became the guardian of her guardians; since it was equally natural to Mr. and Mrs. Kent to throw themselves in helpless reliance on every one whom they did not nervously fear or mistrust.<br><br>"Yes, he's off on Monday," Mr. Raycie said, nodding sharply at Lewis, who had set down his glass after one sip. "Empty it, you shirk!" the nod commanded; and Lewis, throwing back his head, gulped down the draught, though it almost stuck in his lean throat. He had already had to take two glasses, and even this scant conviviality was too much for him, and likely to result in a mood of excited volubility, followed by a morose evening and a head the next morning. And he wanted to keep his mind clear that day, and to think steadily and lucidly of Treeshy Kent.<br><br>Of course he couldn't marry her -- yet. He was twenty-one that very day, and still entirely dependent on his father. And he wasn't altogether sorry to be going first on this Grand Tour. It was what he had always dreamed of, pined for, from the moment when his infant eyes had first been drawn to the prints of European cities in the long upper passage that smelt of matting. And all that Treeshy had told him about Italy had confirmed and intensified the longing. Oh, to have been going there with her -- with her as his guide, his Beatrice! (For she had given him a little Dante of her father's, with a steel-engraved frontispiece of Beatrice; and his sister Mary Adeline, who had been taught Italian by one of the romantic Milanese exiles, had helped her brother out with the grammar.)<br><br>The thought of going to Italy with Treeshy was only a dream; but later, as man and wife, they would return there, and by that time, perhaps, it was Lewis who would be her guide, and reveal to her the historic marvels of her birthplace, of which after all she knew so little, except in minor domestic ways that were quaint but unimportant.<br><br>The prospect swelled her suitor's bosom, and reconciled him to the idea of their separation. After all, he secretly felt himself to be still a boy, and it was as a man that he would return: he meant to tell her that when they met the next day. When he came back his character would be formed, his knowledge of life (which he already thought considerable) would be complete; and then no one could keep them apart. He smiled in advance to think how little his father's shouting and booming would impress a man on his return from the Grand Tour...<br><br>The gentlemen were telling anecdotes about their own early experience in Europe. None of them -- not even Mr. Raycie -- had travelled as extensively as it was intended that Lewis should; but the two Huzzards had been twice to England on banking matters, and Commodore Ledgely, a bold man, to France and Belgium as well -- not to speak of his early experience in the Far East. All three had kept a vivid and amused recollection, slightly tinged with disapprobation, of what they had seen -- "Oh, those French wenches," the Commodore chuckled through his white teeth -- but poor Mr. Kent, who had gone abroad on his honeymoon, had been caught in Paris by the revolution of 1830, had had the fever in Florence, and had nearly been arrested as a spy in Vienna; and the only satisfactory episode in this disastrous, and never repeated, adventure, had been the fact of his having been mistaken for the Duke of Wellington (as he was trying to slip out of a Viennese hotel in his courier's blue surtout) by a crowd who had been -- "Well, very gratifying in their enthusiasm," Mr. Kent admitted.<br><br>"How my poor brother Julius could have lived in Europe! Well, look at the consequences --" he used to say, as if poor Treeshy's plainness gave an awful point to his moral.<br><br>"There's one thing in Paris, my boy, that you must be warned against: those gambling-hells in the Pally Royle," Mr. Kent insisted. "I never set foot in the places myself; but a glance at the outside was enough."<br><br>"I knew a feller that was fleeced of a fortune there," Mr. Henry Huzzard confirmed; while the Commodore, at his tenth glass, chuckled with moist eyes: "The trollops, oh, the trollops --"<br><br>"As for Vienna --" said Mr. Kent.<br><br>"Even in London," said Mr. Ambrose Huzzard, "a young man must be on his look-out against gamblers. Every form of swindling is practised, and the touts are always on the look-out for greenhorns; a term," he added apologetically, "which they apply to any traveller new to the country."<br><br>"In Paris," said Mr. Kent, "I was once within an ace of being challenged to fight a duel." He fetched a sigh of horror and relief, and glanced reassuredly down the Sound in the direction of his own peaceful roof-tree.<br><br>"Oh, a duel," laughed the Commodore. "A man can fight duels here. I fought a dozen when I was a young feller in New Erleens." The Commodore's mother had been a southern lady, and after his father's death had spent some years with her parents in Louisiana, so that her son's varied experiences had begun early. "'Bout women," he smiled confidentially, holding out his empty glass to Mr. Raycie.<br><br>"The ladies --!" exclaimed Mr. Kent in a voice of warning.<br><br>The gentlemen rose to their feet, the Commodore quite as prompt and steadily as the others. The drawing-room window opened, and from it emerged Mrs. Raycie, in a ruffled sarsenet dress and Point de Paris cap, followed by her two daughters in starched organdy with pink spencers. Mr. Raycie looked with proud approval at his womenkind.<br><br>"Gentlemen," said Mrs. Raycie, in a perfectly even voice, "supper is on the table, and if you will do Mr. Raycie and myself the favour --"<br><br>"The favour, ma'am," said Mr. Ambrose Huzzard, "is on your side, in so amiably inviting us."<br><br>Mrs. Raycie curtsied, the gentlemen bowed, and Mr. Raycie said: "Your arm to Mrs. Raycie, Huzzard. This little farewell party is a family affair, and the other gentlemen must content themselves with my two daughters. Sarah Anne, Mary Adeline --"<br><br>The Commodore and Mr. John Huzzard advanced ceremoniously toward the two girls, and Mr. Kent, being a cousin, closed the procession between Mr. Raycie and Lewis.<br><br>Oh, that supper-table! The vision of it used sometimes to rise before Lewis Raycie's eyes in outlandish foreign places; for though not a large or fastidious eater when he was at home, he was afterward, in lands of chestnut-flour and garlic and queer bearded sea-things, to suffer many pangs of hunger at the thought of that opulent board. In the centre stood the Raycie <i>�pergne</i> of pierced silver, holding aloft a bunch of June roses surrounded by dangling baskets of sugared almonds and striped peppermints; and grouped about this decorative "motif" were Lowestoft platters heavy with piles of raspberries, strawberries and the first Delaware peaches. An outer flanking of heaped-up cookies, crullers, strawberry short-cake, piping hot corn-bread and deep golden butter in moist blocks still bedewed from the muslin swathings of the dairy, led the eye to the Virginia ham in front of Mr. Raycie, and the twin dishes of scrambled eggs on toast and broiled blue-fish over which his wife presided. Lewis could never afterward fit into this intricate pattern the "side-dishes" of devilled turkeylegs and creamed chicken hash, the sliced cucumbers and tomatoes, the heavy silver jugs of butter-coloured cream, the floating-island, "slips" and lemon jellies that were somehow interwoven with the solider elements of the design; but they were all there, either together or successively, and so were the towering piles of waffles reeling on their foundations, and the slender silver jugs of maple syrup perpetually escorting them about the table as black Dinah replenished the supply.<br></p><h2>Writings for a Liberation Psychology</h2><p><p>"In your country," Ignacio Mart�n-Bar� remarked to a North American colleague, "it's publish or perish. In ours, it's publish <i>and</i> perish." In November 1989 a Salvadoran death squad extinguished his eloquent voice, raised so often and so passionately against oppression in his adopted country. A Spanish-born Jesuit priest trained in psychology at the University of Chicago, Mart�n-Bar� devoted much of his career to making psychology speak to the community as well as to the individual. This collection of his writings, the first in English translation, clarifies Mart�n-Bar�'s importance in Latin American psychology and reveals a major force in the field of social theory.</p><p>Gathering essays from an array of professional journals, this volume introduces readers to the questions and concerns that shaped Mart�n-Bar�'s thinking over several decades: the psychological dimensions of political repression, the impact of violence and trauma on child development and mental health, the use of psychology for political ends, religion as a tool of ideology, and defining the "real" and the "normal" under conditions of state-sponsored violence and oppression, among others. Though grounded in the harsh realities of civil conflict in Central America, these essays have broad relevance in a world where political and social turmoil determines the conditions of daily life for so many. In them we encounter Mart�n-Bar�'s humane, impassioned voice, reaffirming the essential connections among mental health, human rights, and the struggle against injustice. His analysis of contemporary social problems, and of the failure of the social sciences to address those problems, permits us to understand not only the substance of his contribution to social thought but also his lifelong commitment to the campesinos of El Salvador.</p></p><p><p>Adrianne Aron is a member of the Committee for Health Rights in Central America.</p><p>Shawn Corne is a member of the Committee for Health Rights in Central America.</p><p>Elliot G.

When we meet him years later in Havana, Iv�n is a loser: a humbled and defeated man with a quiet, unremarkable life who earns his modest living as a proofreader at a veterinary magazine. One afternoon, he meets a mysterious foreigner in the company of two Russian wolfhounds. This is "the man who loved dogs," and as the pair grow closer, Iv�n begins to understand that his new friend is hiding a terrible secret. <br>Moving seamlessly between Iv�n's life in Cuba, Ram�n's early years in Spain and France, and Trotsky's long years of exile, <i>The Man Who Loved Dogs </i>is Padura's most ambitious and brilliantly executed novel yet. This is a story about political ideals tested and characters broken, a multilayered epic that effortlessly weaves together three different plot threads&#x2015; Trotsky in exile, Ram�n in pursuit, Iv�n in frustrated stasis&#x2015;to bring emotional truth to historical fact. <br>A novel whose reach is matched only by its astonishing successes on the page, <i>The Man Who Loved</i> <i>Dogs </i>lays bare the human cost of abstract ideals and the insidious, corrosive effects of life under a repressive political regime.</p></p><p><p><b>Leonardo Padura</b> was born in Havana, Cuba, in 1955.

The certainty that life can be the worst hell, and that the remains of fear and pain were disappearing forever with that descent, overcame me with paltry relief. I wondered if I wasn&#x2019;t in some way envious of my wife&#x2019;s final passage toward silence, since being dead, totally and truly dead, for some can be the closest thing to a blessing from that God with whom Ana tried to involve me, without much success, in the last years of her difficult life. <br>As soon as the grave diggers finished moving over the stone and placed the wreaths of flowers our friends had brought on the grave, I turned and walked away, resolved to escape the hands patting my shoulder and the habitual expressions of condolence that we always feel obliged to offer. Because at that moment every other word in the world is superfluous: only the pastor&#x2019;s well-worn formula had meaning and I didn&#x2019;t want to lose it. <i>Rest</i> and <i>peace</i>: what Ana had finally attained and what I also asked for. <br>When I sat down inside the Pontiac to await Daniel&#x2019;s arrival, I knew that I was about to pass out, and I was sure that if my friend didn&#x2019;t remove me from the cemetery, I would have been unable to find the way back to my life. The September sun was burning the top of the car, but I didn&#x2019;t feel up to moving to any other place. With what little strength I had left, I closed my eyes to control the vertigo of loss and fatigue while I felt the acidic sweat running down over my eyelids and cheeks, springing from my armpits, neck, arms. It was soaking my back scorched by the vinyl seat until it turned into a warm current that flowed down my legs in search of the cistern of my shoes. I wondered if that foul sweat and my deep exhaustion were not the prelude to my molecular disintegration, or at least the heart attack that would kill me in the next few minutes. It seemed to me that either could be an easy, even desirable solution, although frankly unfair: I didn&#x2019;t have the right to force my friends to bear two funerals in three days. <br>&#x201c;Are you ill, Iv�n?&#x201d; Dany&#x2019;s question, through the window, surprised me. &#x201c;Holy shit, look at how much you&#x2019;re sweating&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I want to leave&nbsp;&#x2026; But I don&#x2019;t know how, dammit&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re leaving, my friend, don&#x2019;t worry. Wait a minute, let me give a few pesos to the grave diggers,&#x201d; he said, my friend&#x2019;s words transmitting a patent sense of life and reality that seemed strange to me, decidedly remote. <br>Once again I closed my eyes and remained motionless, sweating, until the car was set in motion. Only once the air coming through the window began to calm me down did I dare to raise my eyelids. Before leaving the cemetery, I was able to see the last row of tombs and mausoleums, eaten away by the sun, weather, and oblivion, as dead as their inhabitants, and&#x2014;with or without any reason for doing so at that moment&#x2014;I again asked myself why, amid so many possibilities, some faraway scientists had chosen my name specifically to baptize the ninth tropical storm of that season. <br>Although at this point in my life I&#x2019;ve learned&#x2014;or rather have been taught, and not in a very nice way&#x2014;not to believe in chance, the coincidences were too many that led the meteorologists to decide, many months ahead of time, that they would call that storm &#x201c;Ivan&#x201d;&#x2014;a masculine name starting with the ninth letter of the alphabet, in Spanish, that had never been used before for that purpose. The fetus of what would become Ivan was spawned by the meeting of ominous clouds in the vicinity of Cape Verde, but it wasn&#x2019;t until a few days later, already baptized and converted into a hurricane with all of its properties, that it would rear its head in the Caribbean to place us in its ravenous sight&nbsp;&#x2026; You&#x2019;ll see why I think that I have reasons enough to believe that only twisted fate could have determined that that particular cyclone, one of history&#x2019;s fiercest, would carry my name, just when another hurricane was closing in on my existence. <br>Even though it had been quite a long time&#x2014;perhaps too long&#x2014;since Ana and I had known that her end was decreed, the many years during which we dragged her illnesses had accustomed us to living with them. But the news that her osteoporosis&#x2014;probably caused by the vitamin-deficient polyneuritis unleashed in the most difficult years of the crisis in the 1990s&#x2014;had developed into bone cancer, had made us face the evidence of an end that was near, and given me the macabre proof that only a perverse fate could be responsible for burdening my wife specifically with that illness. <br>From the beginning of the year, Ana&#x2019;s decline had accelerated, although it was in the middle of July, three months after the definitive diagnosis, that her final agony began. Although Gisela, Ana&#x2019;s sister, came frequently to help me, I practically had to stop working to take care of my wife; and if we survived those months, it was thanks to the support of friends like Dany, Anselmo, or Frank the doctor, who frequently came through our small apartment in the neighborhood of Lawton to drop off some supplies drawn from the wretched harvests that, for their own subsistence, they managed to obtain in the most devious ways. More than once, Dany offered to come help me with Ana, but I rejected his overtures, since pain and misery are among the few things that, when shared, always multiply. <br>The scene we lived between the cracked walls of our apartment was as depressing as can be imagined, although the worst thing, under the circumstances, was the strange power with which Ana&#x2019;s broken body clung to life, even against its owner&#x2019;s will. <br>In the early days of September, when Hurricane Ivan, having reached its full potential, had just crossed the Atlantic and was nearing the island of Grenada, Ana had an unexpected period of lucidity and an unforeseen relief to her pain. As it had been her decision not to go to the hospital, a neighboring nurse and our friend Frank had taken over the task of providing her with intravenous fluids and the dose of morphine that kept her in a startling lethargy. Upon seeing that reaction, Frank warned me that this was the denouement and recommended that I give the patient only those foods that she asked for, not insisting on the intravenous fluids and, as long as she wasn&#x2019;t complaining of pain, stopping all drugs to thus give her some final days of intelligence. Then, as if her life had returned to normal, an Ana with various broken bones and very open eyes became interested again in the world around her. With the television and radio on, she fixed her attention in an obsessive way on the path of the hurricane that had initiated its deathly dance devastating the island of Grenada, where it had left more than twenty dead. On many occasions throughout those days, my wife lectured me on the hurricane&#x2019;s characteristics, one of the strongest in meteorological history, and attributed its elevated powers to the climate change the planet was undergoing, a mutation of nature that could do away with the human species if the necessary measures were not taken, she told me, completely convinced. That my dying wife was thinking of everyone else&#x2019;s future only added to the pain I was already suffering. <br>While the storm neared Jamaica with the obvious intention of later penetrating eastern Cuba, Ana developed a sort of meteorological excitement capable of keeping her on constant alert, a tension she escaped only when sleep conquered her for two or three hours. All of her expectations were related to Ivan&#x2019;s doings, with the number of dead it left in its path&#x2014;one in Trinidad, five in Venezuela, another in Colombia, five more in Dominica, fifteen in Jamaica, she added, counting on her crooked fingers&#x2014;and, above all, the calculations of what it would destroy if it penetrated Cuba through any of the points marked as possible trajectories deduced by the specialists. Ana experienced a kind of cosmic communication at the point of the symbiotic confluence of two bodies that know they are destined to consume themselves in the span of a few days, and I began to speculate whether the illness and the drugs had not made her crazy. I also thought that if the hurricane didn&#x2019;t come through soon and Ana didn&#x2019;t calm down, I would be the one who ended up going crazy. <br>The most critical period&#x2014;for Ana and, logically, for each of the island&#x2019;s inhabitants&#x2014;occurred when Ivan, with sustained winds of approximately 150 miles per hour, began to pass over the seas to the south of Cuba. The hurricane was moving with a lazy arrogance, as if it were perversely choosing the point at which it would inevitably turn north and break the country in two, leaving an enormous wake of ruins and death. With bated breath and her senses clinging to the radio and the color television that a neighbor had lent us, a Bible near one hand and our dog Truco beneath the other, Ana cried, laughed, cursed, and prayed with a strength that was not her own. For more than forty-eight hours she remained in that state, watching Ivan&#x2019;s careful approach as if her thoughts and prayers were indispensable to keeping the hurricane as far away as possible from the island, blocking it in that almost incredible westward path from which it couldn&#x2019;t resolve to deviate to the north and flatten the country, as all historic, atmospheric, and planetary logic predicted. <br>The night of September 12, when information from satellites and radars and the unanimous opinion of meteorologists around the world were certain that Ivan would chart a course for the north and that with its battering gusts, gigantic waves, and rain squalls, it would rejoice in the final destruction of Havana, Ana asked me to remove from the wall of our room the dark, corroded wooden cross that twenty-seven years before the sea had given me&#x2014;the driftwood cross&#x2014;and place it at the foot of the bed. Then she begged me to make her a very hot hot chocolate and some toast with butter. If what was supposed to happen happened, that would be her last supper, because the battered ceiling of our apartment would not withstand the force of the hurricane, and she, it goes without saying, refused to move from there. After drinking the hot chocolate and nibbling a piece of toast, Ana asked me to lay the driftwood cross next to her and began to pray with her eyes fixed on the ceiling and on the wooden beams guaranteeing its balance and, perhaps, with her imagination devoted to playing out the images of the apocalypse lying in wait for the city. <br>The morning of September 14, the meteorologists announced a miracle: Ivan had turned toward the north at last, but it had done so so far to the west of the designated zone that it barely brushed the westernmost point of the island without causing any major damage. Apparently the hurricane had felt remorse for the many calamities piling up, and had steered away from us, convinced that its passing through our country would have been an excess of bad fate. Worn out by so much praying, with her stomach ravaged by lack of food, but satisfied by what she considered to be a personal victory, Ana fell asleep after hearing confirmation of that cosmic whim, and in the grimace that had become habitual on her lips there was something very much like a smile. Ana&#x2019;s breathing, strained for so many days, was relaxed again and, along with her fingers caressing Truco&#x2019;s wiry hair, was the only sign in the next two days that she was still alive. <br>On September 16, practically at nightfall, while the hurricane started to disintegrate on U.S. soil and to lose the already diminished force of its winds, Ana stopped caressing our dog and, a few minutes later, stopped breathing. She was at last resting, I&#x2019;d like to think, in eternal peace. <br>In due time you will understand why this story, which is not the story of my life (although it also is), begins as it does. And although you still don&#x2019;t know who I am or have any idea what I&#x2019;m going to tell you, perhaps you will have understood something: Ana was a very important person to me. So much so that, to a large degree, it is because of her that this story exists&#x2014;in black and white, I mean. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Ana crossed my path at one of those all so frequent times during which I was teetering on the edge of a precipice. The glorious Soviet Union had started its death rattle, and the lightning bolts of the crisis that would devastate the whole country in the 1990s were beginning to come down on us. It was predictable that one of the first consequences of the national debacle had been the closing, due to a lack of paper, ink, and electricity, of the veterinary medicine magazine where for ages I had worked as a proofreader. Just like dozens of press workers, from typesetters to editors, I had ended up in an artisans&#x2019; workshop where we were supposed to devote ourselves, for an indefinite period of time, to making macram� crafts and polished seed decorations that, everyone knew, no one would be able to or dare to buy. Three days into this new and useless destiny, without even having the decency to quit, I fled from that honeycomb of enraged and frustrated bees and, thanks to my friends the veterinarians whose texts I have reviewed so many times or even rewritten, I was able to start working shortly after as a sort of ubiquitous helper in the likewise poverty-stricken clinic of the University of Havana&#x2019;s School of Veterinary Medicine. <br>Sometimes I am so overly suspicious that I come to wonder if that whole series of global, national, and personal decisions (they were even talking about &#x201c;the end of history,&#x201d; just when we had begun to have an idea about what the history of the twentieth century was) had as its only objective that I be the one who received, at the end of a rainy afternoon, the desperate and dripping young woman who, carrying a shaggy poodle in her arms, appeared at the clinic and begged me to save her dog, which was afflicted with an intestinal blockage. Since it was after four o&#x2019;clock and the doctors had already left, I explained to the girl (she and the dog were trembling from the cold and, observing them, I felt my voice falter) that we couldn&#x2019;t do anything. Then I saw her break into tears: her dog was dying, she said to me; the two veterinarians who had seen him didn&#x2019;t have anesthesia to operate on him; and since there weren&#x2019;t any buses in the city, she had come walking in the rain with her dog in her arms, and I <i>had</i> to do something, for the love of God. Something? I still ask myself how it&#x2019;s possible that I dared to, or if in reality I was already wanting to dare to; but after explaining to the girl that I was not a veterinarian and asking her to write her petition on a piece of paper and sign it, thus freeing me of all responsibility, the dying Tato became my first surgical patient. If the God invoked by the girl had ever decided to protect a dog, it had to be that afternoon, since the operation&#x2014;about which I had read so much and seen carried out more than once&#x2014;was a success in practice. <br>Depending on how you look at it, Ana was the woman that I most needed or who was least advisable for me at that moment: fifteen years younger than me, too undemanding in the way of material things, horrible and wasteful as a cook, a passionate dog lover, and gifted with a strange sense of reality that made her go from the most eccentric ideas to the firmest and most rational decisions. From the beginning of our relationship she had the ability to make me feel like I had been looking for her for many, many years. That&#x2019;s why I didn&#x2019;t find it strange when, a few weeks into...</p><h2>German-English Genealogical Dictionary</h2><p>This book is designed for the family researcher who has little or no knowledge of German but who nevertheless needs to make a translation of German-language documents.

But when detailing the many things that the poor have not, we often overlook the most critical&#x2014;their health. The poor die sooner. Blacks die sooner. And poor urban blacks die sooner than almost all other Americans. In nearly four decades as a doctor at hospitals serving some of the poorest communities in Chicago, David A. Ansell, MD,&nbsp; has witnessed firsthand the lives behind these devastating statistics. In <i>The Death Gap</i>, he gives a grim survey of these realities, drawn from observations and stories of his patients.<br><br> While the contrasts and disparities among Chicago&#x2019;s communities are particularly stark, the death gap is truly a nationwide epidemic&#x2014;as Ansell shows, there is a thirty-five-year difference in life expectancy between the healthiest and wealthiest and the poorest and sickest American neighborhoods. If you are poor, where you live in America can dictate when you die. It doesn&#x2019;t need to be this way; such divisions are not inevitable. Ansell calls out the social and cultural arguments that have been raised as ways of explaining or excusing these gaps, and he lays bare the structural violence&#x2014;the racism, economic exploitation, and discrimination&#x2014;that is really to blame. Inequality is a disease, Ansell argues, and we need to treat and eradicate it as we would any major illness. To do so, he outlines a vision that will provide the foundation for a healthier nation&#x2014;for all.<br><br> Inequality is all around us, and often the distance between high and low life expectancy can be a matter of just a few blocks. But geography need not be destiny, urges &nbsp;Ansell. In <i>The Death Gap</i> he shows us how we can face this national health crisis head-on and take action against the circumstances that rob people of their dignity and their lives.</p><p><b>David A.

He is the author of <i>County: Life, Death, and Politics at Chicago&#x2019;s Public Hospital</i>."Compelling. . . . Without providing easy answers, Ansell challenges readers to be aware of health disparities and to work toward equality."<br> &nbsp; (<i>Christian Century</i>)<br><br>"This passionate polemic uses powerful patient stories to highlight the importance of neighbourhood conditions, healthcare inequalities and poverty in explaining the health gap between black and white Americans. Drawing on detailed case studies of racial inequalities in breast cancer mortality, the health consequences of mass imprisonment, immigration status and access to healthcare, the Chicago heatwave and Hurricane Katrina, Ansell vividly unpicks a spider&#x2019;s web of causality. . . .&nbsp;This is a wide-ranging and very important book. Easy to read and engaging, it makes the social determinants come alive." (Clare Bambra <i>Times Higher Education</i>)<br><br>"Ansell's passionately written&nbsp;<i>The Death Gap</i>&nbsp;presents a powerful case for social inequality as a cause of disease and disparities in health. . . .&nbsp;Moving beyond epidemiological frameworks that model what would happen to an individual exposed to a single causal factor, Ansell weaves a much more complicated story, in which structures of disadvantage affect every step of the process of survival.&nbsp;<i>The Death Gap</i> provides an overarching framework for understanding the root cause of ethno-racial and economic disparities in illness that seamlessly weaves together the very best research in epidemiology, public health, medical sociology, health policy and psychology." (<i>Nature</i>)<br><br>"Ansell does a great job of showing that poverty is not simply a lack of money, but also a major health and death risk. I would recommend this book to healthcare providers, policymakers, and the general public. Readers will gain knowledge of the health struggles that those in poverty-stricken neighborhoods face, and some of the structural issues that cause these problems. Ansell does not shy away from offering even radical solutions. We would be wise to take him seriously." (<i>Poverty &amp; Public Policy</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Ansell does a magnificent job of uncovering the myriad ways in which structural racism &#x2014;&nbsp;in housing, employment, education, and health care, for a start&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;creates unacceptable &#x2018;death gaps&#x2019; or disparities in life expectancy that are preventable and therefore morally unacceptable. &nbsp;This moving study delivers the harsh truth about the ways that racism infects our nation&#x2019;s health care system, and it does so with passion and eloquence. &nbsp;One comes away from <i>Death Gap </i>feeling inspired to act, and that&#x2019;s a rare and wonderful accomplishment.&#x201d; (Beryl Satter, author of Family Properties: How the Struggle over Race and Real Estate Transformed Chicago and Urban America)<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;<i>The Death Gap</i> describes critical health inequalities in the United States, which are drawn from Ansell&#x2019;s&nbsp; gripping first-person experiences as a leading practitioner operating in Chicago&#x2019;s medical safety net.

Jance can move Brady from an exciting, dangerous scene on one page to a sensitive, touching personal moment on the next. In her latest outing, Brady is looking into two major crimes. But that doesn&#39;t stop her from giving a terrific speech about why selling Girl Scout cookies gave her confidence, or worrying about a friend trying to adopt a child in China, or even finally beginning to understand what makes her annoying mother tick. Earlier books in the Brady series: Desert Heat, Tombstone Courage, Shoot, Don&#39;t Shoot. Jance also authors the popular J.P. Beaumont series, which includes Dismissed With Prejudice, Failure to Appear, Lying in Wait, Name Withheld, Without Due Process.The Bookcassette� format is a special recording technique developed as a means of condensing the full, unabridged audio text of a book to record it on fewer tapes. In order to listen to these tapes, you will need a cassette player with balance control to adjust left/right speaker output. Special adaptors to allow these tapes to be played on any cassette player are available through the publisher or some US retail electronics stores.</p><h2>The Magic Journey</h2><p>Boom times came to the forgotten little southwestern town of Chamisaville just as the rest of America was in the Great Depression. They came when a rattletrap bus loaded with stolen dynamite blew sky high, leaving behind a giant gushing hot spring. Within minutes, the town&#39;s wheeler-dealers had organized, and within a year, Chamisaville was flooded with tourists and pilgrims. The wheeler-dealers were rich -- and that was only the beginning . . .</p><p>"John Nichols Has All Of Steinbeck's Gifts, the same overwhelming compassion for people, plus an even finer sense of humor, and the need to celebrate the cause and dignity of man....He has left as with a classic American trilogy for our time." -- Chicago Tribune<p></p><p>"A storyteller of uncommon wit and inventiveness."</p><p>-- The Cleveland Plain Dealer</p><p>"Nichols is a wise man who writes about human nature with a sense of humor and with delicate feeling."</p><p>-- Library Journal</p><p><b>John Nichols</b>'s <i>New Mexico trilogy</i>, inaugurated in 1974 with the publication of <i>The Milagro Beanfield War</i>, has grown from regional stature to national appeal, from literary radicals to cult classics.

The snow from the night before had stopped falling. There wasn&#x2019;t much traffic, mostly cabs and an occasional noisy snowplow. It was two weeks before Christmas. A Salvation Army worker in full uniform was ringing a bell beside a tripod bucket at the corner of Boylston and Berkeley.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad we don&#x2019;t exchange presents anymore,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Me too,&#x201d; Susan said. &#x201c;Have you canceled your account at Victoria&#x2019;s Secret?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Reluctantly. But they still send me the catalog.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You could probably have your name removed from the list,&#x201d; Susan said.<br><br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;<br><br>She smiled.<br><br>We went into a women&#x2019;s boutique, where the staff seemed to know Susan. I found a chair designed for a woman who weighed 108 pounds. I resumed my lifelong comparative study of the female form. Susan had opened a nearly insurmountable lead. That was no reason not to see who might be runner-up. Or in the top ten. After about forty minutes we left. Susan had bought what she referred to as a &#x201c;lovely little top.&#x201d; And several small packages in a shopping bag decorated with a large Santa Claus.<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t think Jews did Christmas shopping,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;More often we do Christmas selling. You do realize there&#x2019;s a group of us at Harvard who gather every year and drink wine and exchange one gift each.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Any men in this group?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sounds like a fun crowd. A gathering of Harvard women.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It can get a little fustian at times,&#x201d; Susan said. &#x201c;But I like these women, and there&#x2019;s something sort of nice about a girls&#x2019; night out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sort of like Hawk and me at the fights?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sort of.&#x201d;<br><br>We turned the corner and into the bar door of the Taj Boston, formerly the Ritz, for a libation at the table we liked overlooking the Garden.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have a glass of Edna Valley chardonnay,&#x201d; Susan said to the waiter.<br><br>&#x201c;Johnnie Walker Blue, soda, highball,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>Susan smiled at me. &#x201c;I like your Christmas spirit.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And I like yours.&#x201d;<br><br>Susan sipped her wine. &#x201c;Why do you suppose a grown woman, a doctor, a therapist at that, feels at Christmastime the same sense of excitement and anticipation she did when she was just a girl?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps we&#x2019;ll need to discuss this later,&#x201d; I said, lifting my glass.<br><br>&#x201c;I do hope so,&#x201d; Susan said, and raised her glass to me. &#x201c;At length.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br><b>I&nbsp;STOOD AT MY OFFICE WINDOW </b>and looked out at the snow falling quietly onto the Back Bay and muffling the gleam of the Christmas lighting in the store windows. The snow had come often this year.<br><br>&#x201c;Fa, la, la,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>Pearl raised her head. She was with me on a take-your-dog-to-work day, which she spent, as she often did, on the couch in my office. I looked at her.<br><br>&#x201c;La, la,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>She didn&#x2019;t know what I was talking about, but she was used to that. She could also sense that whatever it was, it had no connection to food. So she put her head back down on her paws and watched me in silent resignation.<br><br>I liked the myth elements of Christmas. The way in which its origins reach back far beyond Jesus, to the rituals of people unknown to us. The celebration of the winter solstice. The coming of light in the darkest time. And with it the promise of spring to come and beginning again. I liked it better than Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.<br><br>I went to my desk and sat down.<br><br>&#x201c;Actually,&#x201d; I said to Pearl, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve had bad colds I liked better than Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.&#x201d;<br><br>I sensed movement in her look. Then she lost interest and snapped her head toward the door and made a low growl. Hospitality dog.<br><br>The door opened and a kid came in.<br><br>He looked at Pearl and said, &#x201c;That dog going to bite me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;unless you attack me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Attack you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Uh-huh.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;For crissake, I&#x2019;m a fucking kid.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I guessed that. Have a seat.&#x201d;<br><br>Still watching Pearl, the kid sat down opposite my desk. His face was pointy and his eyes were close. He was wearing gray sweatpants that were too long for him. The bottoms of the pant legs were torn and ragged where the heel of his sneakers had repeatedly caught in them. His jacket was a threadbare navy peacoat, also too big, with the sleeves turned back. Under it was a gray hoodie. His baseball cap had a flat brim, and he wore it level and straight under the hood.<br><br>&#x201c;How old are you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Eleven, I think.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You think?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah. I was there, but I don&#x2019;t remember it, you know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What about your parents? You know them?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My old lady was a drunk. I don&#x2019;t think she knew who my old man was.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She the one who raised you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Awhile,&#x201d; the kid said. &#x201c;Then she didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Run off?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wherever she went, she went.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So who raised you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The orphanage.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How was that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sucked,&#x201d; the kid said. &#x201c;You wanna hear why I come to see you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I live in a place.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>He made a looping gesture with his right hand.<br><br>&#x201c;Around,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Nice neighborhood.&#x201d;<br><br>The kid frowned at me. He was so street-worn and tough-talking and life-weary that I forgot he was only eleven. Irony is not the long suit of eleven-year-olds.<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know where I live,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I was just making a little joke.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t funny.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Probably not. What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Slide.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Last name?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Slide,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>I nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;What do you want me to do for you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I want you to talk with Jackie,&#x201d; Slide said.<br><br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s Jackie?&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Jackie asked me to come here and deliver his message. He needs to see you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What does he want to talk to me about?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll tell you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He seen you on the TV.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t Jackie come?&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;He sent me. He wanted to know if you would see him,&#x201d; Slide said.<br><br>&#x201c;How long have you known Jackie?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A few weeks,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>I nodded. &#x201c;And before that?&#x201d;<br><br>He shuffled uncomfortably in the chair. &#x201c;Did odd jobs. Slept where I could. The Y. You know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Uh-huh,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Will you see Jackie?&#x201d;<br><br>I took a card out of the middle drawer of my desk and gave it to him.<br><br>&#x201c;You or Jackie call me when you&#x2019;re ready,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>The kid took the card and put it in the side pocket of his pants without looking at it. Then he stood up and looked at me and didn&#x2019;t say anything and turned and went out.<br><br>I went to my window and watched him walk through the snow, his shoulders hunched, hands in his pockets, staying close to the walls of buildings, until he turned the corner onto Boylston Street and disappeared in the direction of the Public Garden.<br><b>WE WERE AT MY PLACE. </b>I was making supper. Susan was at my kitchen counter. Pearl had stretched out the length of the sofa, longer than one would think possible for a seventy-five-pound dog.<br><br>&#x201c;Tell me more about this boy who came to see you,&#x201d; Susan said.<br><br>&#x201c;His name is Slide, he&#x2019;s eleven, and he lives with someone named Jackie in a place whose location is unknown.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s all?&#x201d; she said.<br><br>I mixed bread crumbs and pignolis with a little olive oil and began to toast them in a fry pan on low.<br><br>&#x201c;Except he&#x2019;s terrified of his own shadow.&#x201d; I stirred the contents of the pan, which were beginning to brown.<br><br>&#x201c;And who is Jackie?&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;Not much to go on,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>I took the fry pan off the fire and emptied the toasted crumbs and pignolis into a bowl. I took an Amstel Light out of the refrigerator and opened it. I poured it into a tall glass. After a swallow, I said, &#x201c;If you didn&#x2019;t know, how old would you think you were?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Twenty-eight,&#x201d; Susan said.<br><br>&#x201c;Plausible,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But you&#x2019;re far too smart to be only twenty-eight.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I try to conceal that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You fail.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wonder why Jackie sent a boy instead of coming himself,&#x201d; Susan said. I watched her sip her wine. After an hour, the glass was still half full. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll talk with Jackie?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If he gets in touch,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;What if it&#x2019;s something illegal,&#x201d; Susan said.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s illegal and illegal,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I make part of my living from that fact.&#x201d;<br><br>Susan nodded.<br><br>I turned up the heat under the pot of water on the stove and put some whole-wheat linguine in it and set my timer. I sat on a bar stool opposite Susan, who took another sip and said, &#x201c;Let me see if I have this right. Slide is sent by this guy named Jackie, who may or may not ever appear. And although you don&#x2019;t fully grasp the situation, something about Slide has got you interested in helping him, whether Jackie&#x2019;s activities are legal or not.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Slide&#x2019;s eleven going on thirty. So far life hasn&#x2019;t been full of good times for him. He&#x2019;s afraid. Somewhere along the line he got scared, real bad. Of who, or what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And maybe Jackie is the key to figuring out what&#x2019;s happening,&#x201d; Susan said.<br><br>The timer went off and I went over and drained the linguine. &#x201c;Whatever Jackie turns out to be, or whether or not he shows up, Slide is definitely in some kind of trouble.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Slide is a convenient cover for Jackie to hide whatever he&#x2019;s up to,&#x201d; Susan said. &#x201c;And since he didn&#x2019;t come himself, it would appear that at the very least Slide is being used.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A Boston version of Oliver Twist,&#x201d; I said. I plated the pasta and brought the plates over to the counter.<br><br>&#x201c;There wasn&#x2019;t much Charles Dickens in our house,&#x201d; Susan said.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s because you spent your time reading the diaries of Sigmund Freud.&#x201d; I picked up my fork. &#x201c;A match made in heaven.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So deep down, we&#x2019;re really just a couple of Victorians?&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe not. Just that we were educated early in the analysis of motivation,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Dickens, Freud, they&#x2019;re all alike in the dark.&#x201d;<br><br>Susan laughed. &#x201c;Mrs. Freud might disagree with you on that.&#x201d;<br><br>It was quiet for a moment. Then Susan said, &#x201c;Have you given any thought to how we should spend Christmas?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Only that we should be together.&#x201d; I glanced over at the softly snoring Pearl. &#x201c;With Pearl, of course. Hawk, too. Maybe ask Paul if he can join us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll do it at my place. You know how I love to set a nice table for Christmas.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A beautiful paradox,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But anywhere you are, it&#x2019;s Christmas to me.&#x201d;<br><b>THE NEXT MORNING </b>I met Hawk at the Harbor Health Club. Hawk was doing combinations on the heavy bag and I was hitting the double-end jeeter bag with my left hand. Hawk didn&#x2019;t break a sweat. After ten minutes I was sodden and winded.<br><br>&#x201c;You do any more damage to that bag, we&#x2019;ll have to get Henry a new one for Christmas,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Fuck Christmas,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Wow,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And people say you&#x2019;re not sentimental. You still bitter that Santa Claus is a white man?&#x201d;<br><br>Hawk began to hit the bag alternately with both hands.<br><br>&#x201c;Whole holiday be a white man&#x2019;s scam. All those rich honkies running in and out of stores like they might miss buying the last Rolls on the floor. Bentley&#x2019;s beneath them.&#x201d; He shifted his feet a little and started hitting the heavy bag with his left hand.<br><br>&#x201c;This from a guy who drives a Jaguar,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I would think you&#x2019;d appreciate a nice Rolls.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jag be subtle elegance, babe. Rolls just someone tryin&#x2019; too hard to impress people who don&#x2019;t know better. That&#x2019;s Christmas.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, Ebenezer, you had better work on your holiday spirit, or Susan&#x2019;s going to rescind her invitation to Christmas dinner.&#x201d;<br><br>Hawk stopped, lightly tapped the bag with his left hand, and looked at me.<br><br>&#x201c;Christmas dinner? At Susan&#x2019;s?&#x201d;<br><br>I nodded. &#x201c;We could call it a Kwanzaa dinner, if that would improve your mood.&#x201d;<br><br>Hawk ignored me. &#x201c;Just the three of us?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And Pearl,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;How about Paul?&#x201d;<br><br>Paul Giacomin had spent several Christmases with Susan and me in the years since I had helped liberate him from his parents.<br><br>&#x201c;Susan called&#x2014;Paul will be at his in-laws&#x2019; this Christmas. We may visit him in New York after the New Year.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So just us? And Pearl?&#x201d;<br><br>I nodded. &#x201c;Unless there&#x2019;s someone special you&#x2019;d like to invite.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No one special at the moment.&#x201d; Hawk grinned. &#x201c;&#x2019;Course, it ain&#x2019;t Christmas yet.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So can I let Susan know you&#x2019;ll be cruising by in the Jag to join us?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tell Susan I&#x2019;m looking forward to it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can feel her blushing already,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>Hawk went back to pummeling the heavy bag.<br><br>&#x201c;Dinner better be at Susan&#x2019;s house, though. Wouldn&#x2019;t park my car in your neighborhood, even if it is just a Jag.&#x201d;<br><br>After we wound down, we walked to the South Street Diner at Kneeland Street. Hawk ordered a coffee with skim milk and two Equals. No donut. I ordered a coffee and two corn muffins. Between the first and second muffin, I told him about Slide. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s the most terrified kid trying not to show it I&#x2019;ve ever seen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I knew a boy like that once,&#x201d; Hawk said.<br><br>&#x201c;You.&#x201d; I said it without thinking, knowing I was right.<br><br>Hawk looked at me. To the world, Hawk appeared impassive and impenetrable. And mostly, he was. I had been around him long enough, though, that I could recognize subtle changes. Things most people didn&#x2019;t see, or didn&#x2019;t notice. But I knew Hawk&#x2014;to the extent anyone could know him&#x2014;better than most people did. And now it was Christmas, a time for revelations. Maybe Susan could explain it to me. Perhaps it was a vestige of our need to huddle by the cave fire together and tell stories, to ward off the darkness outside.<br><br>Hawk stirred his coffee. I watched the people come and go by the cash register, bundled up against the eighteen-degree weather.<br><br>&#x201c;When I was about Slide&#x2019;s age, I hit the streets. The winter was always the worst. I got money to eat any way I could.&#x201d; Hawk looked at me. &#x201c;Any way.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This kid is scared. I don&#x2019;t see you being scared.&#x201d;<br><br>Hawk took a sip of his coffee. He placed the cup back down on the saucer and leveled his gaze at me.<br><br>&#x201c;All kids scared one time or other. You on your own, you learn how to take care of yourself.&#x201d;<br><br>I nodded. &#x201c;You survive long enough, you learn not to be afraid.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Or you don&#x2019;t survive, and it don&#x2019;t matter.&#x201d;<br><br>Hawk drained the rest of his coffee, then counted out his tip.<br><br>&#x201c;You have help?&#x201d;<br><br>Hawk stood up and slid into his parka.<br><br>&#x201c;Lotta help, &#x2019;long the way,&#x201d; he said. He paused. &#x201c;One day I meet a cocktail waitress and she help me grow up real fast. I was sixteen and she was twenty.&#x201d; He grinned. &#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t been scared since.&#x201d;<br><b>WHILE I WASN&#x2019;T FEELING </b>particularly holly jolly about Christmas, I was quite interested in Christmas dinner. Sometimes we went out, and sometimes we stayed home, where I cooked and Susan stayed out of the way. I had been pondering wild boar.

He won three Oscars for costume design. He dressed all the biggest stars, from Bette Davis to Marilyn Monroe. Yet few know who Orry-Kelly really was - until now. Discovered in a pillowcase, Orry-Kelly&#39;s long-lost memoirs reveal a wildly talented and cheeky rascal who lived a big life, on and off the set. From his childhood in Kiama to revelling in Sydney&#39;s underworld nightlife as a naive young artist and chasing his dreams of acting in New York, his early life is a wild and exciting ride. Sharing digs in New York with another aspiring actor, Cary Grant, and partying hard in between auditions, he ekes out a living painting murals for speakeasies before graduating to designing stage sets and costumes. When The Kid from Kiama finally arrives in Hollywood, it&#39;s clear his adventures have only just begun. Fearless, funny and outspoken, Orry-Kelly lived life to the full. In Women I&#39;ve Undressed, he shares a wickedly delicious slice of it.&#34;</p><p>Orry-Kelly was born Orry George Kelly in Kiama in 1897. His love of theatre and nightlife flourished when he moved to Sydney at seventeen. In 1922 the aspiring actor and artist moved to New York, where his work painting murals for nightclubs led to designing stage sets and costumes. He followed his dreams to Hollywood and became head of the costume department at Warner Bros. Orry-Kelly went on to create some of the most iconic looks in movie history, from Casablanca and The Maltese Falcon to Oklahoma! and Auntie Mame, in a career spanning thirty years and 295 films. He won Oscars for An American in Paris, Les Girls and Some Like It Hot.A work of art... He proves as elegant a writer as he was a fashion designer... Women I&#39;ve Undressed is a must for fashion freaks and movie buffs alike. * Weekend West * Those of us who assume Hollywood costume designers are as camp as Christmas - e.g. Cecil Beaton or Dame Edna&#39;s son Kenny - will need to have a rethink in the light of this tremendous book. * Daily Mail * Several books have already laid bare the fractious relationship between movie star and designer, but Orry-Kelly&#39;s account of life as a prominent Hollywood costume designer leaves most of them in the ha&#39;penny place. Found in a pillowcase and kept under wraps by his family for half a century, it is an Aladdin&#39;s cave of memories and moments. * Sunday Business Post * He writes with deep affection... His book is beautifully designed and illustrated... Orry-Kelly&#39;s pen portraits bring the city and the period pungently to life. * The Australian * Delightful... Kelly was an extraordinary character... A camp romp through the Golden Age of Hollywood with some gloriously indiscreet asides, peppered with Kelly&#39;s exquisite sketches and photos of stars in his frocks. * Australian Women&#39;s Weekly * A sumptuous coffee table fashion tome but the text reads like a racy Jackie Collins novel... Women I&#39;ve Undressed is a frank and brutal account of Hollywood&#39;s golden era, of its stars and their foibles, their individual weaknesses and Achilles&#39; heels, the details that only a personal tailor gets to see, but more importantly, this book brings recognition to one of the most talented costume designers of the era... He was Hollywood royalty, but despite those Oscars, he was not a household name. This book will likely change that.&#39; * Irish Independent * There&#39;s something completely compelling about this very talented, very outlandish, gay Australian rascal&#39;s journey into Hollywood. -- Gillian Armstrong, the Oscar-nominated director of Women He&#39;s Undressed If you love or even like Old Hollywood, if you hanker after parties where Marlene Dietrich, Carole Lombard, Hedy Lamarr and Jean Harlow chew the fat in Spanish costumes under camellia-strewn bowers, then Orry-Kelly&#39;s Women I&#39;ve Undressed: the Fabulous Life and Times of a Legendary Hollywood Designer is a little bit of paradise. * Daily Telegraph *</p><h2>The Berenstain Bears on the Moon</h2><p>Illus. in full color.

In <i>How Are You Peeling?</i>--by the creator of the whimsical <i>Play with Your Food</i>--the "natural personalities" of produce are enhanced with black-eyed pea eyes and the occasional carved mouth--then photographed in vivid colors.

(Ages 2 to 6) <i>--Richard Farr</i>In the fertile mind of artist/sculptor Saxton Freymann, a cauliflower is a poodle, an artichoke is a wolf, a banana is an octopus, and a pumpkin is just about anything. Fruits and veggies - meticulously carved, then photographed - are his special gift to the bountiful world of children&#39;s literature. &#34;What&#39;s great about food,&#34; he says, &#34;is that it keeps all of the photos fun.&#34; Freymann lives in New York City with his wife and three children, all of whom are very healthy, he says, because they eat the cast of characters he works on.

The result was Play With Your Food, his first collaboration with Saxton Freymann, and a bestseller for the whole family. Joost believes that if you can open children&#39;s eyes and thinking with things they can understand and duplicate - like food creations - a new range of creativity opens up. &#34;Then,&#34; he says, &#34;you can take them to a museum.&#34;</p><h2>The Northern Renaissance A&amp;I (Art and Ideas)</h2><p>An up-to-date survey of this dynamic period of artistic innovation.</p><p>Jeffrey Chipps Smith holds the Kay Fortson Chair in European Art at the University of Texas at Austin.

Yep, this one still sells, too!</p><p>Long before Dr. Bob Rotella made tweaking a golfer's head as important as tweaking his swing, Tim Gallwey, who knew virtually nothing about the mechanics of the game when he penned the first edition of this visionary work, understood that even the best technique collapses when the mind cracks under the game's pressure. Gallwey's ultimate insight into the game was that a golfer's mind is a golfer's worst enemy; too much thinking only gets in the way.<p> The new edition of this groundbreaking instructional continues to preach such "Inner Game" fundamentals as trust, concentration, visualization, feel, and relaxation, and is full of what Gallwey calls "awareness exercises." Much of what he has to say seems obvious in a world in which most good athletes have some kind of psychological guru always at the ready to help improve performance, but Gallwey, with his bagful of anecdotes and encouragement, was one of the first to explore this uncharted territory, and still remains one of the most readable. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p>6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Sister Outsider: Audre Lorde (Penguin Modern Classics)</h2><p><p><i>The woman's place of power within each of us is neither white nor surface; it is dark, it is ancient, and it is deep</i></p><p>The revolutionary writings of Audre Lorde gave voice to those 'outside the circle of this society's definition of acceptable women'.

A treasure worth killing for. Sam Spade, a slightly shopworn private eye with his own solitary code of ethics. A perfumed grafter named Joel Cairo, a fat man name Gutman, and Brigid O&#39;Shaughnessy, a beautiful and treacherous woman whose loyalties shift at the drop of a dime. These are the ingredients of Dashiell Hammett&#39;s iconic, influential, and beloved The Maltese Falcon.</p><p>Sam Spade, Dashiell Hammett's archetypally tough San Francisco detective, is more <i>noir</i> than <i>L.A. Confidential</i> and more vulnerable than Raymond Chandler's Marlowe. In <i>The Maltese Falcon</i>, the best known of Hammett's Sam Spade novels (including <i>The Dain Curse</i> and <i>The Glass Key</i>), Spade is tough enough to bluff the toughest thugs and hold off the police, risking his reputation when a beautiful woman begs for his help, while knowing that betrayal may deal him a new hand in the next moment.<p> Spade's partner is murdered on a stakeout; the cops blame him for the killing; a beautiful redhead with a heartbreaking story appears and disappears; grotesque villains demand a payoff he can't provide; and everyone wants a fabulously valuable gold statuette of a falcon, created as tribute for the Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV. Who has it? And what will it take to get it back? Spade's solution is as complicated as the motives of the seekers assembled in his hotel room, but the truth can be a cold comfort indeed.</p><p> Spade is bigger (and blonder) in the book than in the <i>movie</i>, and his Mephistophelean countenance is by turns seductive and volcanic. Sam knows how to fight, whom to call, how to rifle drawers and secrets without leaving a trace, and just the right way to call a woman "Angel" and convince her that she is. He is the quintessence of intelligent cool, with a wise guy's perfect pitch. If you only know the movie, read the book. If you're riveted by <i>Chinatown</i> or wonder where Robert B. Parker's Spenser gets his comebacks, read the master. <i>--Barbara Schlieper</i></p>"Dashiell Hammett. . . is a master of the detective novel, yes, but also one hell of a writer." --<b>The Boston Globe</b><br><br>"<b>The Maltese Falcon</b> is not only probably the best detective story we have ever read, it is an exceedingly well written novel."--<b>The Times Literary Supplement</b> (London)<br><br>"Hammett's prose [is] clean and entirely unique.

Now a crew member on his father&#x2019;s sky pirate ship, the <i>Stormchaser</i>, his dream seems fulfilled. But a much higher destiny awaits Twig. The lofty city of Sanctaphrax&#x2014;built on a giant rock, floating high in the sky&#x2014;is at the point of disaster. The city&#x2019;s future is dependent on stormphrax&#x2014;a valuable substance available only from the heart of a Great Storm. And only the <i>Stormchaser</i>, with Twig onboard, could risk entering a storm. . . .</p><p>In this second installment to Paul Stewart and Chris Riddell's fabulous <i>Edge Chronicles</i>, life doesn't get any easier for young Twig. He's left the behind the monstrous, tooth-and-claw dangers of <i>Beyond the Deepwoods</i>, only to find himself plunged into the more diabolical, deadly intrigues of Undertown and the floating city Sanctaphrax. <p> Serving aboard the magnificent sky-ship <i>Stormchaser</i>, Twig is still trying to prove himself to his pirate father Cloud Wolf--with mixed results. As old plots and schemes unfold, Twig learns that his father was once known as Qunitinius Verginix, "the finest Knight Academic in a hundred generations," entrusted by the Professors of Light and Darkness to secure "stormphrax" (the sacred, super-heavy substance that keeps the city of Sanctaphrax from sailing skyward). Betrayal forced Twig's father into piracy, but the seeds sown by that misdeed have only now come to fruit, through a convoluted conspiracy of corruption. Now the <i>Stormchaser</i> must sail again--Twig, in tow, of course--chasing the Great Storm in search of stormphrax.</p> <p> The pace only quickens in Stewart and Riddell's well-done, slightly scary series, and younger readers should be warned that these books don't pull too many punches. Fortunately the occasional violence is much like you'd find in Grimm's tales: brief and often just. Addicted American fans slavering for the next book in this British series will be glad to know they can look forward to many more installments.

It&#x2019;ll be a great ice-breaker,&#x201d; said Rooney, and returned to the other end of the bar, where the three lively customers were busy paying the college tuition for the as-yet-unborn Rooney children.<br><br>For a few minutes, Tim worked at convincing himself that beer and pretzels were all he needed. Conviction was assisted by picturing Shaydra as a bovine person with one eyebrow and foot-long braided nose hairs.<br><br>As usual, the tavern soothed him. He didn&#x2019;t even need the beer to take the sharp edges off his day; the room itself did the job, though he did not fully understand the reason for its calming effect.<br><br>The air smelled of stale beer and fresh beer, of spilled brine from the big sausage jar, of bar wax and shuffleboard powder. From the small kitchen came the aroma of hamburgers frying on a griddle and onion rings crispening in hot oil.<br><br>The warm bath of agreeable scents, the illuminated Budweiser clock and the soft shadows in which he sat, the murmurs of the couples in the booths behind him and the immortal voice of Patsy Cline on the jukebox were so familiar that by comparison his own home would seem to be foreign territory. <br><br>Maybe the tavern comforted him because it represented, if not permanence, at least continuance. In a world rapidly and ceaselessly transforming, the Lamplighter resisted the slightest change.<br><br>Tim expected no surprises here, and wanted none. New experiences were overrated. Being run down by a bus would be a new experience. <br><br>He preferred the familiar, the routine. He would never be at risk of falling off a mountain because he would never climb one.<br><br>&nbsp;Some said he lacked a sense of adventure. Tim saw no point in suggesting to them that intrepid expeditions through exotic lands and across strange seas were the quests of crawling children compared to the adventures waiting in the eight inches between the left ear and the right.<br><br>If he made that observation, they would think him a fool. He was just a mason, after all, a bricklayer. He was expected not to think too much.<br><br>These days, most people avoided thinking, especially about the future. They preferred the comfort of blind convictions to clear-eyed thought.<br><br>Others accused him of being old-fashioned. Guilty as charged. <br><br>The past was rich with known beauty and fully rewarded a look backward. He was a hopeful man, but not presumptuous enough to assume that beauty lay, as well, in the unknown future. <br><br>An interesting guy came into the tavern. He was tall, although not as tall as Tim, solid but not formidable. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>His manner, rather than his appearance, made him interesting. He entered like an animal with a predator on its trail, peering back through the door until it swung shut, and then warily surveying the premises, as though distrusting the promise of refuge.<br><br>When the newcomer approached and sat at the bar, Tim stared at his Pilsner glass as if it were a sacred chalice, as though he were brooding on the profound meaning of its contents. By assuming a devotional demeanor, rather than a pose of sullen solitude, he allowed strangers the option of conversation without encouraging it.<br><br>If the first words out of the newcomer&#x2019;s mouth were those of a bigot or a political nut, or the wrong kind of fool, Tim could morph from a pose of spiritual or nostalgic reverie to one of bitter silence and barely repressed violence. Few people would try more than twice to break the ice when the only response was a glacial chill.<br>Tim preferred quiet contemplation at this altar, but he enjoyed the right kind of conversation, too. The right kind was uncommon. <br><br>When you initiated a conversation, you could have a hard time putting an end to it. When the other guy spoke first, however, and revealed his nature, you could shut him down by shutting him out.<br><br>Diligent in the support of his yet-to-be-conceived children, Rooney arrived. &#x201c;What&#x2019;ll it be?&#x201d; <br><br>The stranger put a thick manila envelope on the bar and kept his left hand on it. &#x201c;Maybe . . . a beer.&#x201d; <br><br>Rooney waited, eyebrows raised. <br><br>&#x201c;Yes. All right. A beer,&#x201d; said the newcomer. <br><br>&#x201c;On tap, I have Budweiser, Miller Lite, and Heineken.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Okay. Well . . . then . . . I guess . . . Heineken.&#x201d; <br><br>His voice was as thin and taut as a telephone wire, his words like birds perched at discreet intervals, resonant with a plucked note that might have been dismay.<br><br>By the time Rooney brought the beer, the stranger had money on the bar. &#x201c;Keep the change.&#x201d; <br><br>Evidently a second round was out of the question. <br><br>When Rooney went away, the stranger wrapped his right hand around the beer glass. He did not take a sip. <br><br>Tim was a wet nurse. That was the mocking title Rooney had given him because of his ability to nurse two beers through a long evening. Sometimes he asked for ice to enliven a warm brew.<br><br>Even if you weren&#x2019;t a heavy drinker, however, you wanted the first swallow of beer when it was at its coldest, fresh from the tap.<br><br>Like a sniper intent on a target, Tim focused on his Budweiser, but like a good sniper, he also had keen peripheral vision. He could see that the stranger had still not lifted the glass of Heineken.<br><br>The guy did not appear to be a habitu� of taverns, and evidently he didn&#x2019;t want to be in this one, on this night, at this hour.<br><br>At last he said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m early.&#x201d; <br><br>Tim wasn&#x2019;t sure if this was a conversation he wanted. <br><br>&#x201c;I guess,&#x201d; said the stranger, &#x201c;everyone wants to be early, size things up.&#x201d; <br><br>Tim was getting a bad vibe. Not a look-out-he&#x2019;s-a-werewolf kind of vibe, just a feeling that the guy might be tedious.<br><br>The stranger said, &#x201c;I jumped out of an airplane with my dog.&#x201d; <br><br>On the other hand, the best hope of a memorable barroom conversation is to have the good luck to encounter an eccentric.<br><br>Tim&#x2019;s spirits lifted. Turning to the skydiver, he said, &#x201c;What was his name?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Whose name?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;The dog&#x2019;s.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Larry.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Funny name for a dog.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I named him after my brother.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What did your brother think of that?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;My brother is dead.&#x201d; <br><br>Tim said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry to hear it.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;That was a long time ago.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Did Larry like sky-diving?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;He never went. He died when he was sixteen.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I mean Larry the dog.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Yeah. He seemed to like it. I bring it up only because my stomach is in knots like it was when we jumped.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;This has been a bad day, huh?&#x201d; <br><br>The stranger frowned. &#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d; <br><br>Tim nodded. &#x201c;Bad day.&#x201d; <br><br>Continuing to frown, the skydiver said, &#x201c;You are him, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; <br><br>The art of barroom banter is not like playing Mozart on the piano. It&#x2019;s freestyle, a jam session. The rhythms are instinctual.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you him?&#x201d; the stranger asked again. <br><br>Tim said, &#x201c;Who else would I be?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;You look so . . . ordinary.</p><h2>Covers of the Saturday Evening Post: Seventy Years of Outstanding Illustration</h2><p>From 1899 to 1969, millions of Americans saw themselves each Tuesday in the cover art of the most popular magazine in the country.

His photo-portraits (Auden, Chagall, Hitchcock, Spencer Tracy, Marlene Dietrich et al.) seem to spring out of a conspiratorial partnership with his sitters. He also has done impressionistic advertising photography that Corot might envy. Painterly still lifes are as provocative as the anatomically probing nudes. Penn's continually surprising imagination turns to animal skulls, cigarette butts, multicolored lips, street garbage--odd mementos to "the ultimate sadness of all vanity," as Liberman, editorial director of Conde Nast, writes in his perceptive introduction. Along with a steady stream of fashion photography that resembles a species of cultural anthropology, Penn, as we see here, has recently done powerful color drawings in a biomorphic cubist style. This album includes 71 tipped-in color plates and 397 black-and-whites, along with Penn's running commentary. The printing is of superb quality. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.In 1941 Penn, then an associate in Vogue 's art department handling the magazine's layouts, was encouraged by Alexander Lieberman to pick up a camera and do the actual photography instead. Since then, he has been producing images at once penetrating and mysterious. While Penn's incisive portraits of both the famous and the unknown--particularly ethnic peoples he posed carefully in studios--capture the specifics even as he renders the sitters timeless, his graceful yet boldly inventive fashion photography has gone far beyond the standard expectations of that genre. In fact, perhaps the most remarkable aspect of this overview is its demonstration that, in the hands of a master, the line between fashion photography and art photography simply does not exist. Penn provides some rather brief commentary on the images displayed here, but the photographs themselves--thoughtfully laid out, beautifully reproduced--make the book.

Its famed Art Deco District was designated a Historic District by the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, and today the area is basking in a revival of interest and attention. Nevertheless, while fashion photographers and entrepreneurs, artists, developers, restaurateurs and club owners flock to the neighborhood, it is still struggling, after years of deterioration and neglect, to recreate itself out of its own forgotten glamour. Despite a new palette of confectionery colors and the renovation of numerous buildings, the Art Deco District remains in need of urban cultivation, of a reinterpretation that transcends its original resort identity. Author Laura Cerwinske introduces <i>Tropical Deco: The Architecture and Design of Old Miami Beach</i> by discussing both the area's past and its future. Throughout her comprehensive exploration of the most concentrated neighborhood of Art Deco buildings in the world, she details the style's evolution and examines its design.<br><br><i>Tropical Deco: The Architecture and Design of Old Miami Beach </i>treats its readers to a delightful view of a unique adaption of a historic architectural style. For, while Miami Beach's Art Deco architecture derives its stylistic roots from the streamlined and electric visions of the cosmopolitan North, Tropical Deco design is much softer and more temperately seductive. These are buildings whose narrative and evocative nature is at once sophisticated, naive and filled with humor.<br></p><p><b>Laura Cerwinske</b>'s commentaries on architecture, interior design, garden design and fine art appear regularly in numerous publications.

Photographs.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: FrenchSympathetic, perfectly tuned biography of France's most word- wild, controversial novelist ever, whose sins put Zola and Genet in the shade; by French C&#x201a;line-scholar Vitoux, and superbly translated by Browner. According to Vitoux, only three of C&#x201a;line's novels are now available in English: Journey to the End of the Night, Death on the Installment Plan, and Guignol's Band. C&#x201a;line (1894-1961) was a towering stylist who invented his own gutter argot. He wrote...fulminated!...blew his guts into your face!...with three little dots...smashing all grammar!...no subjects! stinking predicates!...a rich black delirium of Shakespearean belches!- -though in Journey, his first foulmouthed masterpiece, he'd not yet invented the three dots. Born to the petite bourgeoisie as Louis- Ferdinand Destouches, he suffered poor health most of his life, wrote scathingly of the stifling, gaslit Paris passageway in which he spent his youth, created a monster of his father (really a rather nice guy), was wounded in WW I, reeled from headaches and hallucinations and ever after complained of a train passing by in his left ear. C&#x201a;line, a doctor, traveled (or fled) greatly, always visiting health clinics wherever he went, especially in the US: A visit to the Ford auto plant in Dearborn produced a chapter of bilious satire in Journey. When that novel was published, Vitoux tells us, France swooned with joy and horror, and Death on the Installment Plan brought such geysers of outrage that C&#x201a;line became a paranoid victim of persecution mania and wrote two filthy anti- Semitic tracts, for which he was vilified for the rest of his life and which helped land him in prison for a year in postwar Denmark. He died having finished a horrific trilogy about WW II; its central novel, North, is now a classic. Vitoux makes few excuses for C&#x201a;line but does show that his anti-Semitism was both a mania and a literary artifice. Strong stuff. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Now, this expanded edition provides similar insights on the Apocrypha, presenting a significant view of the lives and religious experiences of women as well as attitudes toward women in the Second Temple period.

She is on the editorial advisory board of the Old Testament Library series.<br><br><b>Sharon H. Ringe</b> is Professor of New Testament at Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington, D.C.The past two decades have seen the growth of feminist biblical studies into a significant force within biblical scholarship. This landmark work brings the fruits of these labors together into a single fascinating collection. Like previous single-volume commentaries, this provides introduction and comments on each book of the Protestant Bible (with a brief treatment of the apocryphal writings). Unlike the others, however, this work is not a traditional commentary, which entails explaining the whole of each biblical book. Rather, the writers focus on "portions . . . that deal explicitly with female characters and symbols . . . and sections that bear upon the condition of women generally." Although the contributors share this goal, they take different paths. In addition to the commentary itself, there are helpful essays on feminist hermeneutics and daily life in biblical times. This commentary will raise eyebrows, and it will raise consciousness as well. It will not be well received in all quarters, but it is essential for those who are seriously interested in biblical and feminist studies.

The book contains filmic images that subvert the usual narrative chronology; it is focused on the theme of youth, doomed or saved. A fourteenth-century folktale of two boys who set out to find happiness, the story of Francis and Clare with their revolutionary visions, the Tsarnaev brothers of Boston, the poet George Oppen and the philosopher Simone Weil, two strangers who loved but remain strange, and the wild-child Brigid of Ireland: all these emerge "from multiple directions, but always finally from the eye at the end." As the philosopher Richard Kearney writes, "Howe's ruminations and aesthetics are those of the fragmentary, but are unified by world thinkers like Arendt, Weil, Agamben, and Yeats." <i>The Needle's Eye</i> is a brilliant and deeply felt exploration of faith and terror, coincidence and perception, by a literary artist of profound moral intelligence, "recognized as one of the country's least compromising yet most readable experimentalist writers" (<i>The Boston Globe</i>).</p></p><p><b>Fanny Howe</b>'s previous book of poetry, <i>Second Childhood</i>, was a finalist for the National Book Award, and her fiction was recently honored as a finalist for the Man Booker International Prize.

It&#x2019;s not just intellectually rigorous and passionate sentence making I&#x2019;m talking about here (and, of course, it is all of that, too), but a unrelenting belief in the power of being a voice in the wilderness&#x2015;a voice that takes energy and gives it to subjects like poverty and the disenfranchisement in the world, who gets to speak and who doesn&#x2019;t, spiritual adventurism, and an allegiance to fairy tales.

Their six-week program is divided into three stages, but you can decide which suggestions will help speed you towards your goals. They begin by simplifying illness and reducing the various causes to five possible categories: Burnout (metabolism), Heat (inflammation), Rust (presence of free radicals or absence of antioxidants), Sludge (nutrition), and Waste (poor detoxification). These five categories are individually complex, but it's not at all difficult to find a few simple steps to take in the direction of healthier living. Some choices--filtering drinking water via reverse osmosis, improving your sleeping habits, or choosing specific supplements to add to your daily regimen--are quick and painless. Others, such as weaning yourself off prescription medications (like anti-inflammatories) and replacing the drugs with micronutrients, are best done in consultation with your own physician. Balancing general suggestions with a deep understanding that people vary greatly in their habits, Liponis and Hyman present a range of possibilities for every age and level of fitness while simultaneously addressing the specific needs of particular illnesses. While the terminology is potentially overwhelming to total novices in complimentary medicine, the book offers clear and excellent possibilities for those who are willing to look outside the box for improved health. <i>--Jill Lightner</i><b>Mark Hyman, M.D.,</b> is the editor in chief of <i>Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine,</i> the most prestigious journal in the field of integrative medicine.

We also follow Thich Nhat Hanh as he returns to Vietnam in 1964 and helps establish the movement known as &#34;engaged Buddhism&#34; - starting self-help villages, a new university, a Buddhist order, and many other efforts for peace. Fragrant Palm Leaves is regarded by many Vietnamese as Thich Nhat Hanh&#39;s most endearing book. This extraordinary translation offers Western readers a glimpse into another time and into the mind of a great thinker and activist. It gives a model of how to live fully, with awareness, during a time of challenge and upheaval.</p><p>To many of his readers, Thich Nhat Hanh is a great inspiration, a model of both spiritual maturity and social responsibility. But his personal life has been a closed book--until now. <i>Fragrant Palm Leaves</i> is the first publication of Thich Nhat Hanh's journals, in this case, those centering around the most decisive period in his life. A young monk in a Zen Buddhist lineage, Nhat Hanh had aspirations of developing a Buddhism that was meaningful in the lives of everyday Vietnamese. The chaos of the Vietnam War ironically offered him the chance to move beyond the strictures of the conservative Buddhist establishment and initiate experimental villages as well as a university, but the same war also forced him from his homeland. In entries written in both Vietnam and America, we see an already seasoned Nhat Hanh thinking through the politics of his tradition, his close friendships and alliances, the future of Buddhism, and the way to bring peace to a war-ravaged time. We also witness his glimmerings of enlightenment and are treated to lyrical passages on the interbeing of all things. <i>Fragrant Palm Leaves</i> is a rare glimpse at a great human being in the making. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>A rare combination of mystic, scholar, poet, and activist, Thich Nhat Hanh has lived in exile from his native Vietnam since 1966. Though he is best known for his ever popular Buddhist teachings, Fragrant Palm Leaves: Journals 1962-1966 shows not only an exquisite portrait of the Zen master as a young man, but the emergence of a great poet and literary voice of Vietnam. From his years as a student and teaching assistant at Princeton and Columbia to his efforts to negotiate peace and a better life for the Vietnamese, Fragrant Palm Leaves offers an elegant and profound window into the formation of the heart and mind of one of the world&#39;s most beloved spiritual teachers.</p><h2>Lincoln&#39;s Spies: Their Secret War to Save a Nation</h2><p><b>A major addition to the history of the Civil War, <i>Lincoln&#x2019;s Spies</i> is a riveting account of the secret battles waged by Union agents to save a nation. Filled with espionage, sabotage, and intrigue, it is also a striking portrait of a shrewd president who valued what his operatives uncovered. </b><br><br>Veteran journalist Douglas Waller, who has written ground-breaking intelligence histories, turns his sights on the shadow war of four secret agents for the North&#x2014;three men and one woman. From the tense days before Abraham Lincoln&#x2019;s inauguration in 1861 to the surrender at Appomattox four years later, Waller delivers a fast-paced narrative of the heroes&#x2014;and scoundrels&#x2014;who informed Lincoln&#x2019;s generals on the enemy positions for crucial battles and busted up clandestine Rebel networks.<br> <br>Famed detective Allan Pinkerton mounted a successful covert operation to slip Lincoln through Baltimore before his inauguration to foil an assassination attempt. But he failed as General George McClellan&#x2019;s spymaster, delivering faulty intelligence reports that overestimated Confederate strength.<br> <br>George Sharpe, an erudite New York lawyer, succeeded Pinkerton as spymaster for the Union&#x2019;s Army of the Potomac. Recruiting skilled operatives, some of whom dressed in Rebel uniforms, Sharpe ran highly successful intelligence operations that outpaced anything the enemy could field.<br> <br>Elizabeth Van Lew, a Virginia heiress who hated slavery and disapproved of secession, was one of Sharpe&#x2019;s most successful agents. She ran a Union spy ring in Richmond out of her mansion, with dozens of agents feeding her military and political secrets she funneled to General Ulysses S. Grant as his army closed in on the Confederate capital. Van Lew became one of the unsung heroes of the war.<br> <br>Lafayette Baker was a handsome Union officer with a controversial past, whose agents clashed with Pinkerton&#x2019;s operatives. The unscrupulous Baker assembled a retinue of disreputable spies, thieves, and prostitutes to root out traitors in Washington, D.C. But he failed at his most important mission: uncovering the threat to Lincoln from John Wilkes Booth and his gang.<br> <br>Behind these secret operatives was a president, one of our greatest, who was an avid consumer of intelligence and a ruthless aficionado of clandestine warfare, willing to take chances to win the war. <i>Lincoln&#x2019;s Spies</i>, as Waller vividly depicts in his excellent new book, set the template for the dark arts the CIA would practice in the future.</p><p>Douglas Waller is a former correspondent for&nbsp;<i>Newsweek</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Time</i>, where he covered the CIA, Pentagon, State Department, White House, and Congress.

He lives in Raleigh, North Carolina.Lincoln&#x2019;s Spies One<p></p> ALLAN PINKERTON<p></p> <br>Though they were still traveling through territory infested with secession sympathizers, the ride from Baltimore to Washington early the morning of February 23, 1861, proved uneventful. Allan Pinkerton finally relaxed. He joined Ward Hill Lamon in sipping from a liquor bottle. Pinkerton had not been particularly thrilled with Abraham Lincoln&#x2019;s hard-drinking Illinois law crony tagging along&#x2014;the fewer people involved in this operation the better, he believed&#x2014;but Mary Lincoln had insisted that the burly bodyguard accompany them as the detective escorted her husband on the dangerous trip to the nation&#x2019;s capital. The blustery Lamon, who sported a uniform he designed for himself, brought along two pistols, a large bowie knife, a pair of brass knuckles, and a thick hickory stick. Though Pinkerton usually abstained from alcohol (he told his son it made him grumpy), the detective could become a cigar-smoking whisky drinker if he needed to play one working a case.<br> <br>Friends and associates believed Allan Pinkerton was gifted with courage and unusual powers of observation. As a young man he had been a labor agitator, falling under the spell of Scottish revolutionaries. He now hated slavery and had become a fanatical abolitionist. He thought his parents had been atheists and he considered himself one as well. He had honed a sixth sense to anticipate criminal activity before it happened. He was stubbornly persistent, refusing to be worn down by adversity. Yet he could be a tiresome prig, who harangued employees, friends, and relatives about the virtues of honesty, integrity, and courage. He was a tyrant at home, completely dominating his wife and children. He had dark, brooding eyes set deeply under a wide brow with a heavy beard that covered his face, save for his upper lip that he occasionally shaved. He was usually dour and humorless, only occasionally showing a sense of humor. He was a master publicist, skilled at promoting his business and shameless about air brushing his image. He was a disciple of phrenology, the pseudo-medicine that determines a person&#x2019;s character and intellect from measurements of the head&#x2019;s size and shape. A phrenologist examined him, writing that the detective&#x2019;s brain measured twenty-three inches (&#x201c;very large,&#x201d; the professor reported) and concluding that he was blessed with &#x201c;earnestness, enthusiasm, heartiness, whole-souledness, impetuosity and excitability.&#x201d;<br> <br>The head of Pinkerton&#x2019;s National Detective Agency had reason to feel satisfied with himself that Saturday morning, February 23. His covert mission had begun a little more than a month earlier when Samuel Morse Felton, a kindly-looking Massachusetts man, hired him to investigate threats to Felton&#x2019;s Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad from prosecessionist saboteurs. The line was a vital rail link from the North to Washington, over which Federal troops and supplies would travel if war broke out with the South. Pinkerton, whose Chicago agency specialized in tracking and capturing train robbers, arrived in Baltimore on February 1 with a squad of his best detectives. Quickly his undercover operatives infiltrated Baltimore&#x2019;s secret societies and paramilitary organizations that supported southern secession from the Union. Each agent was identified on intelligence reports they delivered to him by code names or simply with their initials. Using the pseudonym John H. Hutchinson, Pinkerton posed as a chatty stockbroker from Charleston, South Carolina.<br> <br>It soon became clear to him that the danger was far more serious than railroad vandalism. Practically from the day they arrived, Pinkerton and his detectives began picking up the stories swirling around Baltimore of plots to assassinate the president-elect when he passed through the city. Lincoln, who by tradition remained secluded during his successful 1860 presidential campaign while others stumped for him, had departed Springfield, Illinois, on February 11 for a twelve-day, 1,904-mile, roundabout trip to Washington, D.C., with frequent halts in key states he had won to greet the public and introduce himself to the country before his inauguration the next month as the sixteenth president of the United States. He was scheduled to arrive in Baltimore shortly after noon on February 23.<br> <br>One of four loyal slave states, Maryland had 90,000 blacks in bondage and a determined minority that favored seceding from the Union. The state, which bordered Washington on three sides, had to be kept open to Union resupply for the nation&#x2019;s capital to survive. But Maryland was unstable. A tinderbox rife for assassination plotting, Baltimore, the South&#x2019;s largest and northernmost city, was a logical site to spring the trap. Visitors could reach Washington by train, steamship up the Potomac, or on one of six highways that ran through Virginia or Maryland. The Old Dominion state was far too dangerous to transit through for this president-elect. To reach Washington for his swearing-in, Lincoln had to pass through Maryland and more particularly Baltimore, the key center for railroads that were the most efficient means of moving northern troops in the future to the nation&#x2019;s capital. The best way for secessionists to nullify the election, perhaps to seize Confederate independence quickly, was to kill Lincoln in Baltimore. Pinkerton and his agents infiltrated the city&#x2019;s wealthy class, who they suspected would fund such an assassination plot, as well as its lower-class gangs likely to carry out the murder. They discovered what they believed was compelling evidence that when Lincoln changed trains in the city for the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad line that would take him to Washington, a dense and hostile crowd would surround him from which assassins would emerge to shoot or stab him. As near as Pinkerton could determine, the local police planned no escort or if they did have one it would be with disloyal officers sympathetic to the killers.<br> <br>Pinkerton intercepted Lincoln at Philadelphia&#x2019;s luxurious Continental Hotel the night of February 21 and briefed him on the assassination threat he believed he had uncovered. Lincoln knew the detective and thought highly of his agency. Outwardly the president-elect refused to appear alarmed by personal threats. But there was evidence he was taking them more seriously than he let on. Lincoln began receiving death threats as early as October 1860, when his election victory seemed certain. After the vote, hate mail from all over the country piled up in Springfield. Warnings came that he would be poisoned. Several packages of tainted fruit arrived from the South. Newspapers were filled with stories of sinister forces that would prevent Lincoln from taking office. Washington was alive with rumors of assassination plots and conspiracies to burn down the city. One report out of New Orleans had a $40,000 bounty placed on his head. Lincoln&#x2019;s stepmother worried he never would return home alive from his presidency. So did Springfield friends.<br> <br>It had been a logistical nightmare arranging the president-elect&#x2019;s travel. There was no direct rail line from Springfield to Washington. Instead, he had to chug along at thirty miles per hour over a hodgepodge of fifteen different lines, some of which were run by powerful railroad executives who sympathized with the South. His protection during the trip was woefully inadequate. There was no federal secret service to guard him. Lincoln refused to have an Army escort, believing it made him look like a warlord. No one traveling with him was even officially designated to be responsible for his security, so protection was handled by a makeshift detail of friends and military men aboard the train. In Baltimore, against a large angry crowd and hostile cops, the puny security detail would be easily overpowered.<br> <br>Lincoln agreed to Pinkerton&#x2019;s complex plan to sneak him into Washington ahead of his announced travel schedule while his would-be Baltimore assassins slept. The evening of February 22, the president-elect, with only Lamon to guard him, quietly slipped away from his traveling party of more than a dozen in Harrisburg, where he had delivered an address to the state legislature, and boarded a special Pennsylvania Railroad train that Pinkerton had arranged to take him 110 miles east to Philadelphia. Pinkerton joined the pair in Philadelphia and took them in a carriage shortly after 10 p.m. to the station for Felton&#x2019;s Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad on the south side of town, where they boarded the rear of a sleeping car. Kate Warne, one of Pinkerton&#x2019;s female operatives, had reserved four double berths partitioned off from other passengers, which she told the conductor was for her sick brother.<br> <br>At 3:30 a.m. on February 23, Lincoln, Pinkerton, and Lamon arrived in Baltimore, where the sleeping car was unhitched and pulled by a team of horses to the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad&#x2019;s Camden Street Station a mile away. As dawn was about to break, the B&amp;O&#x2019;s Washington-bound train finally arrived, much to the relief of Pinkerton, who dreaded the thought of the president-elect stranded in a wide-awake Baltimore with just him and Lamon for protection. Lincoln&#x2019;s sleeper car was hooked up to it for the final thirty-eight-mile leg to Washington.<br> <br>After his shot of whisky with Lamon, Pinkerton stretched out on the sleeping car&#x2019;s back platform. The cold wind buffeting his face, he watched as their southbound train sped by quiet hamlets and dingy farmhouses. Pinkerton was not a man given to deep introspection. But it was remarkable, if he ever stopped to think about it, that he had risen from roots as humble as Lincoln&#x2019;s to reach the point where he was now rescuing a future president.<br> <br>Pinkerton could trace his line to seventeenth-century Gorbals, a Scottish burgh on the south bank of the River Clyde, annexed by Glasgow in 1661, which by the nineteenth century had become a bustling factory and workshop center for more than 35,000 people living in squalid thatched houses and multistory tenements along narrow streets.<br> <br>William Pinkerton was a grim-faced muscular man, with a gloomy personality and a modest amount of schooling, who stood about six feet tall and was &#x201c;straight built,&#x201d; according to his son Allan. He likely supplemented his falling income as a home handloom weaver by serving as a Glasgow city jail trustee, which gave him some standing in the community. Allan Pinkerton, who was prone to fabricating parts of his biography, claimed that his father died as a police sergeant battling rioters, but that story appears to have no basis in fact. William&#x2019;s first marriage was to Isabella Stevenson, who bore him seven children (five of whom lived beyond childhood) and who, according to family legend, died after delivering the last one in 1807. In his mid-forties, William married a thirty-three-year-old cotton mill worker named Isabella McQueen, who had Allan and another son, Robert, who survived to adulthood. Allan was born in 1819 in the couple&#x2019;s third-floor tenement apartment on Muirhead Street. The exact day is in dispute. Biographers have it variously as July 21, August 21, and August 25.<br> <br>Little can be confirmed about Allan&#x2019;s childhood. Pinkerton&#x2019;s later accounts of it are riddled with inaccuracies. He claimed the household was &#x201c;completely filled with the tensions of two families existing in a few rooms,&#x201d; but that may not have been the case. William was a stern father, but by the time Allan was five, the children of the first marriage had all left home and only Allan and his brother Robert remained in the apartment. Allan attended elementary school until age nine or ten, when his father died. With a firm grounding by then in reading, writing, and arithmetic he was considered adequately educated for that time. He later regretted not having any more formal schooling and thought he suffered because of it.<br> <br>After several years of odd jobs for pennies a day, Pinkerton at age twelve decided to apprentice with William McCauley, a Gorbals barrel maker, to learn how to be a cooper. Six years later he had earned a journeyman&#x2019;s card. By then, he was five feet eight inches tall with powerful shoulders and arms from hours spent each day pounding iron barrel hoops with a ten-pound hammer. But he described himself as a &#x201c;tramp cooper,&#x201d; roaming Scotland and northern England the next four years finding short-term work that ended each time with layoffs.<br> <br>Industrial unrest swept Glasgow by the end of the 1830s, fueled by a downturn in the British economy, with cotton mill owners cutting wages, thousands of their workers striking, and union leaders being marched off to jail. In 1838, Pinkerton became a Chartist, named for a popular working-class movement whose six-point People&#x2019;s Charter called for democratic reforms and broader suffrage for men. Pinkerton, who became the Glasgow coopers&#x2019; representative to the Chartist Convention in Birmingham, joined the grassroots revolt because &#x201c;I was free in name, but a slave in fact,&#x201d; he recalled. He came to worship the frail yet charismatic George Julian Harney, a London communist among the Chartist leaders, and became Harney&#x2019;s strongman as he traveled through Scotland delivering fiery speeches. On November 4, 1839, Pinkerton joined 5,000 men armed with mostly spears and clubs in the Newport, Wales, uprising to free Henry Vincent, an imprisoned Chartist orator. He escaped being among the twenty-two Chartists whom soldiers killed and the sixty-two whom police arrested after scattering the mob with a volley of musket fire.<br> <br>In April 1841, while organizing a concert at O&#x2019;Neil&#x2019;s Public House to raise money for striking spinners in Glasgow, Pinkerton couldn&#x2019;t take his eyes off fourteen-year-old Joan Carfrae, a bookbinder&#x2019;s apprentice who was singing soprano in the event. An Edinburgh orphan, Joan had been reared by her aunt, who educated her. She was a kind young girl, who sang in Glasgow&#x2019;s Unitarian Church on Center Street and was as committed as Pinkerton was to workers&#x2019; rights. Allan courted her for almost a year before they married on March 13, 1842, when Joan was fifteen. She may have misled Pinkerton into believing she was eighteen. He was twenty-two.<br> <br>The next month, Joan shared a filthy cabin with other women and Allan wedged into the crew&#x2019;s quarters aboard the merchant ship Kent, sailing for America and what the young couple hoped would be a better life. Pinkerton paid for their passage by working as the ship&#x2019;s cooper. Their first stop was to be Montreal, but storms blew the Kent far off course and she foundered 250 miles south on ice and reefs at Sable Island, southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia. A lifeboat carried them to shore, where Indian raiders promptly robbed them of the few possessions they carried, including Joan&#x2019;s wedding ring. In May, they finally reached Montreal with only twenty-five pennies in Pinkerton&#x2019;s pocket. Allan and Joan found a room in a boardinghouse and Allan scratched out a living in Montreal making beef barrels until he was laid off several months later. Giving up on Canada, the couple planned to book a steamer south to Chicago, but they changed their minds and moved instead to the village of Warsaw, in western Illinois. Calamity struck once more&#x2014;they were robbed of everything but the clothes on their back&#x2014;so they decided to return to their original plan and move to Chicago.<br> <br>Chicago in 1842 was a growin...</p><h2>A Left Hand Turn Around the World: Chasing the Mystery and Meaning of All Things Southpaw</h2><p>Traveling from the halls of history to the halls of science, Wolman explores a Scottish castle designed for left-handed swordfights, visits a Paris museum to inspect nineteenth-century brains that hold clues to this biological puzzle, and observes chimps with a primatologist in Atlanta who may help unravel the evolutionary mystery of left-handedness. Along the way, Wolman meets fellow left-handers who share his sense of kinship and reveal the essence of Southpaw. There is sinister Diabolos Rex, follower of the Left Hand Path; and John Evans, an amputee whose left hand was reattached to his right arm. In Japan, Wolman tees off with the National Association of Left-Handed Golfers and seeks wisdom from a left-handed baseball legend. A seamless blend of science, travel, culture, and humor, this inquisitive exploration of all things Southpaw is sure to be the perfect book for lefties and for all the righties who love them.</p><p>Far more detailed than a typical collection of left-handed trivia, David Wolman's <i>Left-Hand Turn Around The World</i> examines 200 years of anatomy in a search for the roots of hand preference. The results are surprising, and perhaps a bit disappointing to anyone who prefers believing "left-handed people are the only ones in their right minds". <p> Wolman travels the world for answers, from a mildly gruesome visit to Broca's bottled brains in a Paris museum to the latest Berkeley research labs. Throughout the journey, the science is as accessible as any animal documentary and as well-documented as any rigorous reader will demand. Included in the mix are a trip to a graphologist's convention and a visit with a gentleman whose handedness is the result of surgically combining his left hand with his right arm. Wolman's Fulbright fellowship-winning reporting is always clear and entertaining&#x2014;he has a fine knack for presenting complex theories in direct, dryly amusing language. He frequently inserts himself into the research, in one case borrowing his nephew for a visit with a pediatric neuropsychologist. </p><p> With the most recent research offering the theory that strength of hand preference is more important than the actual hand preferred, the final conclusion could be an eye opener to those who prefer the old ideas that lefties are more creative, athletic, artistic and generally more wonderful. As Wolman says in conclusion, you can still says lefties are special, because they are. <i>Jill Lightner</i></p><b>David Wolman</b> is a journalist whose work has appeared in such publications as <i>Discover</i>, <i>Newsweek</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, <i>Forbes</i>, <i>Outside</i>, <i>Wired</i>, and the <i>San Jose Mercury News</i>.

Pistone tells the story of working so deep undercover in the Mafia that the truth of his identity became blurry even for him. For six years, Pistone posed as jewel thief Donnie Brasco in order to pull off one of the most audacious sting operations ever. Because any small detail could blow his cover, Pistone adjusted his personality and habits to earn the trust of Mafia soldiers, connected guys, captains, and godfathers. He was so successful that many FBI surveillance teams assumed that he was yet another Mafia guy. This memoir paints a vivid portrait of the underworld of wise guys by revealing their code of honor, their treacherous dealings, their relationships with their wives and mistresses, and their lavish money habits. The suspense in Pistone's story builds as he unfurls his experience of life on the edge of good and evil and on the verge of death.Joseph D. Pistone was an FBI agent for seventeen years. He now lives under a secret identity in an undisclosed location.</p><h2>Kids at Work: Lewis Hine and the Crusade Against Child Labor</h2><p>The Newbery Medal-winning author of Lincoln: A Photobiography provides a close-up profile of Lewis Hine, a New York City schoolteacher and photographer whose dramatic photographs led to the passage of vital legislation against child labor.</p><p><strong>RUSSELL FREEDMAN </strong>received the Newbery Medal for <em>Lincoln: A Photobiography.</em> He is also the recipient of three Newbery Honors, a National Humanities Medal, the Sibert Medal, the Orbis Pictus Award, and the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award, and was selected to give the 2006 May Hill Arbuthnot Honor Lecture. Mr. Freedman lives in New York City and travels widely to research his books.Another fine photo-essay by the author of Lincoln (1987, Newbery Award) Hine (1874-1940) took up photography while teaching at NYC's Ethical Culture School and was soon photographing immigrants at Ellis Island as a teaching tool. He followed his subjects into their city tenements and photographed their children, often hard at work in sweatshop conditions. He's especially remembered as an investigative reporter (1908-18) for the National Child Labor Committee, touring the US to record children as young as three years old working, for long hours and often under very dangerous conditions, in factories, mines, and fields. Freedman offers the salient facts of Hine's life but focuses, with characteristic thoughtfulness, on this phase of his work and the message it so powerfully conveyed, beautifully summed up in the NCLC's 1913 ``Declaration of Dependence'' on behalf of children, which proclaimed children's right ``to play and to dream,'' as well as to get ``normal sleep'' and an education, and called for ``the abolition of child labor.'' But as Freedman points out, legislation--thwarted until the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938--was ultimately the result of economic pressure (adults' need for jobs) rather than humanitarian motives. Sixty-one of Hine's poignantly telling, beautifully composed b&amp;w photos are an integral part of the story. An excellent complement to Cheap Raw Material (p. 560); like Meltzer, Freedman concludes by emphasizing that child labor is a continuing problem. Bibliography of sources; index.

UP.</p><p>Don't go confusing your Thomas Cranmer with your Thomas More; now there is a Tudor faux-pas if ever there was one. Cranmer made the divorce happen, More lost his head over it. Cranmer wrote the <i>Book of Common Prayer</i>, More was the author of <i>Utopia</i>. And it was More who was canonized a saint, while Cranmer was executed by "Bloody" Mary Tudor for his fiendish plotting on behalf of Lady Jane Grey as well as for his embracing an evangelical brand of Protestantism the Catholic queen found wholly disagreeable.

It was a big, rambling stone mansion that she had lived in for fifteen years. The sunny greenhouse room she used as an office looked out over the rosebushes she had planted, the fountain, and the small pond that reflected the sky. The view was peaceful, and the house silent. Her hands had barely moved over the keyboard for the past hour. It was beyond frustrating. Despite a long and successful career in films, she was trying to write her first novel. Although she had written short stories for years, she had never published any. She had even tried her hand at a screenplay once. During their entire marriage, she and her late husband, Sean, had talked about making a movie together, and never got around to it. They were too busy doing other things, in their primary fields.<br><br> Sean was a producer-director, and she was an actress. Not just an actress, Carole Barber was a major star, and had been since she was eighteen. She had just turned fifty, two months before. By her own choice, she hadn't had a part in a movie for three years. At her age, even with her still remarkable beauty, good parts were rare.<br><br> Carole stopped working when Sean got sick. And in the two years since he'd died, she had traveled, visiting her children in London and New York. She was involved in a variety of causes, mostly relating to the rights of women and children, which had taken her to Europe several times, China, and underdeveloped countries around the world. She cared deeply about injustice, poverty, political persecution, and crimes against the innocent and defenseless. She had diligently kept journals of all her trips, and a poignant one of the months before Sean died. She and Sean had talked about her writing a book, in the last days of his life. He thought it was a wonderful idea, and encouraged her to start the project. She had waited until two years after his death to do it. She had been wrestling with writing it for the past year. The book would give her an opportunity to speak out about the things that mattered to her, and delve deep into herself in a way that acting never had. She wanted desperately to complete the book, but she couldn't seem to get it off the ground. Something kept stopping her, and she had no idea what it was. It was a classic case of writer's block, but like a dog with a bone, she refused to give up and let it go. She wanted to go back to acting eventually, but not until she wrote the book. She felt as though she owed that to Sean and herself.<br><br> In August, she had turned down what seemed like a good part in an important movie. The director was excellent, the screenwriter had won several Academy Awards for his earlier work. Her costars would have been interesting to work with. But when she read the script, it did absolutely nothing for her. She felt no pull to it at all. She didn't want to act anymore unless she loved the part. She was haunted by her book, still in its fetal stages, and it was keeping her from going back to work. Somewhere deep in her heart, she knew she had to do the writing first. This novel was the voice of her soul.<br><br> When Carole finally started the book, she insisted it wasn't about herself. It was only as she got deeper into it that she realized that in fact it was. The central character had many facets of Carole in her, and the more Carole got into it, the harder it was to write, as though she couldn't bear facing herself. She had been blocked on it again now for weeks. It was a story about a woman coming of age and examining her life. She realized now that it had everything to do with her, the life she'd led, the men she'd loved, and the decisions she had made in the course of her life. Every time she sat down at her desk to write it, she found herself staring into space, dreaming about the past, and nothing wound up on the screen of her computer. She was haunted by echoes of her earlier life, and until she came to terms with them, she knew she couldn't delve into her novel, nor solve its problems. She needed the key to unlock those doors first, and hadn't found it. Every question and doubt she'd ever had about herself had leaped back into her head with the writing. She was suddenly questioning every move she'd ever made. Why? When? How? Had she been right or wrong? Were the people in her life actually as she'd seen them at the time? Had she been unfair? She kept asking herself the same questions, and wondered why it mattered now, but it did. Immensely. She could go nowhere with the book, until she came up with the answers about her own life. It was driving her insane. It was as though by deciding to write this book, she was being forced to face herself in ways she never had before, ways she had avoided for years. There was no hiding from it now. The people she had known floated through her head at night, as she lay awake, and even in her dreams. And she awoke exhausted in the morning.<br><br> The face that came to mind most often was Sean's. He was the only one she was sure about, who he had been, and what he meant to her. Their relationship had been so straightforward and clean. The others weren't, not to that degree. She had questions in her mind about all of them but Sean. And he had been so anxious for her to write the book she had described to him, she felt she owed it to him, as a kind of final gift. And she wanted to prove to herself that she could do it. She was paralyzed by the fear that she couldn't, and didn't have it in her. She had had with the dream for more than three years now, and needed to know if she had a book in her or not.<br><br> The word that came to mind when she thought of Sean was peace. He was a kind, gentle, wise, loving man, who had been only wonderful to her. He had brought order to her life in the beginning, and together they had built a solid foundation for their life together. He had never tried to own or overwhelm her. Their lives had never seemed intertwined or entangled, instead they had traveled side by side, at a comfortable pace together, right until the end. Because of who he was, even Sean's death from cancer had been a quiet disappearance, a kind of natural evolution into a further dimension where she could no longer see him. But because of his powerful influence on her life, she always felt him near her. He had accepted death as one more step in the journey of his life, a transition he had to make at some point, like a wondrous opportunity. He learned from everything he did, and whatever he encountered on his path, he embraced with grace. In dying, he had taught her yet another intensely valuable lesson about life.<br><br> Two years after he had gone, she still missed him, his laughter, the sound of his voice, his brilliant mind, his company, their long quiet walks together along the beach, but she always had the feeling that he was somewhere nearby, doing his own thing, traveling on, and sharing some kind of blessing with her, just as he had when he was alive. Knowing and loving him had been one of her greatest gifts. He had reminded her before he died that she still had much to do, and urged her to go back to work. He wanted her to make movies again, and write the book. He had always loved her short stories and essays, and over the years she had written dozens of poems to him, which he treasured. She had had all of them bound in a leather folder several months before he died, and he had spent hours reading them over and over again.<br><br> She hadn't had time to start the book before he died. She was too busy taking care of him. She had taken a year off to spend time with him, and nurse him herself when he got really sick, particularly after chemo and in the last few months of his illness. He had been valiant till the end. They had gone for a walk together the day before he died. They hadn't been able to walk far, and they had said very little to each other. They had walked side by side, holding hands, sat down frequently when he got tired, and they had both cried as they sat and watched the sunset. They both knew the end was near. He had died the following night, peacefully, in her arms. He had taken one last long look at her, sighed with a gentle smile, closed his eyes, and was gone.<br><br> Because of the way he'd died, with such elegant acceptance, afterward it had been impossible to be overwhelmed with grief when she thought about him. As best one could be, she was ready. They both were. What she felt in his absence was an emptiness she still felt now. And she wanted to fill that void with a better understanding of herself. She knew the book would help her do that, if she could ever get a handle on it. She wanted to at least try to measure up to him, and the faith he'd had in her. He had been a constant source of inspiration to her, in her life and her work. He had brought her calm and joy, and a kind of serenity and balance.<br><br> In many ways, it had been a relief for her not to work in films for the past three years. She had worked so hard for so long that even before Sean got sick she knew she needed a break. And she knew that time off for introspection would eventually bring deeper meaning to her acting as well. She had made some important movies over the years, and had been in some major commercial hits. But she wanted more than that now, she wanted to bring something to her work that she never had before. The kind of depth that only came with wisdom, seasoning, and time. She wasn't old at fifty, but the years since Sean got sick and died had deepened her in ways she knew she would never have experienced otherwise, and she knew that inevitably that would show on the screen. And if she mastered it, surely in her book as well. This book was a symbol of ultimate adulthood for her, and freedom from the last ghosts of her past. She had spent so many years pretending to be other people through her acting, and appearing to be who the world expected her to be. Now was the time in her life when she wanted to be unfettered by other people's expectations, and finally be herself. She belonged to no one now. She was free to be whoever she wanted to be.<br><br> Her years of belonging to a man had been over long before she met Sean. They had been two free souls, living side by side, enjoying each other with love and mutual respect. Their lives had been parallel, and in perfect symmetry and balance, but never enmeshed. It was the one thing she had feared when they got married, that it would get complicated, or he would try to "own" her, that they might somehow stifle or drown each other. That had never happened. He had assured her it wouldn't, and had kept his promise. She knew that her eight years with Sean were something that only occurred once in a lifetime. She didn't expect to find that with anyone else. Sean had been unique.<br><br> She couldn't imagine herself falling in love, or wanting to be married again. She had missed him for these past two years, but had not mourned him. His love had sated her so totally that she was comfortable now even without him. There had been no agony or pain in their love for each other, although like all couples, they'd had resounding arguments now and then, and then laughed about them afterward. Neither Sean nor Carole was the kind of person to hold a grudge, and there wasn't a shred of malice in either of them, or even in their fights. In addition to loving each other, they had been best friends.<br><br> They met when Carole was forty, and Sean was thirty-five. Although five years younger than she was, he had set an example for her in many ways, mostly in his views about life. Her career was still going strong, and she was making more movies than she wanted to at the time. For so many years before that, she had been driven to follow the path of an ever-more-demanding career. They met five years after she had moved back to Los Angeles from France, and she'd been trying to spend more time with her children, always pulled between her kids, and increasingly alluring movie roles. She had spent the years after her return from France without a serious involvement with a man. She just didn't have the time, or the desire. There had been men she'd gone out with, usually for a brief time, some of them in her business, mostly directors or writers, others who were in different creative fields, art, architecture, or music. They had been interesting men, but she'd never fallen in love with any of them, and was convinced she never would again. Until Sean.<br><br> They had met at a conference they'd both gone to, to discuss the rights of actors in Hollywood, and had been on a panel together about the changing role of women in films. It had never bothered either of them that he was five years younger than she was. It was completely irrelevant to both of them. They were kindred spirits, regardless of age. A month after they met, they had gone to Mexico together for a weekend. He had moved in three months later, and never left. Six months after he moved in, despite Carole's reluctance and misgivings, they were married. Sean had convinced her it was the right thing for both of them. He was absolutely correct, although at first Carole had been adamant about not wanting to get married again. She was convinced that their careers would somehow interfere and cause conflicts between them, and impact their marriage. As Sean had promised, her fears had been unfounded. Their union seemed blessed.</p><h2>Time&#39;s Arrow</h2><p>In <b>Time's Arrow</b> the doctor Tod T.

There she witnessed the full impact of the war and first formed the ambition to write an account of what history - the great political events driven by men of power, wealth, and ambition - does when it reaches the realm of ordinary people struggling for life and bread. <br>The central character in this powerful and unforgiving novel is Ida Mancuso, a schoolteacher whose husband has died and whose feckless teenage son treats the war as his playground. A German soldier on his way to North Africa rapes her, falls in love with her, and leaves her pregnant with a boy whose survival becomes Ida's passion. <br>Around these two other characters come and go, each caught up by the war which is like a river in flood. We catch glimpses of bombing raids, street crimes, a cattle car from which human cries emerge, an Italian soldier succumbing to frostbite on the Russian front, the dumb endurance of peasants who have lived their whole lives with nothing and now must get by with less than nothing. <p>"One of the few novels in any language that renders the full horror of Hitler's war, the war that never gets into the books . . ."-- Alfred Kazan, "Esquire <br>"A storyteller who spellbinds."-- Stephen Spender, "The New York Review of Books <br>"A marvel of a novel . . . all the pleasures that fiction can offer."-- Doris Grumbach, "Saturday Review</p>Born in Rome in 1918, Morante was married to the writer Alberto Moravia. During the last years of World War II, the couple were refugees in the countryside near Cassino. Her first novel, MENZOGNA E SORTILEGIO (1948) was a critical success and won the Viareggio Prize. She was not a prolific writer, with L&#39;ISOLA DI ARTURO appearing nearly ten years later. At the time of publication in 1974 HISTORY was called the novel of the century.

Speaker of the House, senator, secretary of state, five-time presidential candidate, and idol to the young Abraham Lincoln, Henry Clay is captured in full at last in this rich and sweeping biography that vividly portrays all the drama of his times.<br><br>David S. Heidler and Jeanne T. Heidler present Clay in his early years as a precocious, witty, and optimistic Virginia boy, raised on a farm, who at the age of twenty transformed himself from bumpkin to attorney&#x2014;a shrewd and sincere defender of the ordinary man who would be his eventual political base. The authors reveal Clay&#x2019;s tumultuous career in Washington, one that transformed the capital and the country. Nicknamed &#x201c;the Western Star,&#x201d; Clay became the youngest Speaker of the House shortly before the War of 1812 and transformed that position into one of unprecedented power. Then, as a senator, he joined and sometimes fought John Calhoun and Daniel Webster to push through crucial legislation affecting everything from slavery to banking. Commonly regarded as the greatest U.S. senator in history, Clay served under ten presidents and overshadowed most of them, with the notable exception of his archrival Andrew Jackson. Clay ran unsuccessfully for president five times, and his participation in the deadlocked election of 1824 brought about the &#x201c;Corrupt Bargain&#x201d; with John Quincy Adams that made Clay secretary of state&#x2014;and haunted him for the rest of his career. As no other book, Henry Clay humanizes Clay&#x2019;s marriage to plain, wealthy Lucretia Hart, a union rumored to be mercenary on his part but that lasted fifty-three years and produced eleven children.<br><br>Featuring an inimitable supporting cast including Aaron Burr, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, James Polk, and Abraham Lincoln, Henry Clay is beautifully written and replete with fresh anecdotes and insights. But it is Henry Clay who often rises above them all. Horse trader and risk taker, arm twister and joke teller, Clay was the consummate politician who gave ground, made deals, and changed the lives of millions. His life is an astounding tale&#x2014;and here superbly told.</p><p><strong>Why Henry Clay? An Essay by David S. Heidler and Jeanne T. Heidler</strong> <p> </p> <p>Many Americans do not know this extraordinary person, which is a pity. Many years ago, a conference gave us the opportunity to visit his grave and his home. A friend accompanied us to the cemetery where we stood before the large vault with its imposing column topped by a statue of Clay, his right arm partially extended, entreating during one of his famous orations. The day was raw, and a dirty cotton sky sent down a misty drizzle that glossed the marble with a wet patina. In the back portion of the vault, a marble slab held one of Clay&#x2019;s most famous quotes: &#x201c;I had rather be right than be President.&#x201d; Our friend, who inclines to the acerbic, muttered, &#x201c;Nothing about a corrupt bargain?&#x201d; We laughed.</p> <p>Yet later as we walked through the house named Ashland, we paused over the twin legacies of Clay&#x2019;s fateful decision in 1825 and of his unstinting labor to improve and sustain his country. His behavior in 1825 fastened upon him--presumably forever, if our companion&#x2019;s remark was any evidence--the infamy of the &#x201c;Corrupt Bargain.&#x201d; His work for the country revealed the great poignancy of his generation, the futility of practical politics clashing with grave moral imperatives. He sought the presidency and was labeled a schemer; he compromised for the Union and was lauded as a statesman. Which one was the real Henry Clay? In this book we try to answer that question.</p> <p>His personal life, for instance, presents intriguing clues. Clay married what many described as an ugly girl, possibly only for the status and influence her family imparted, but there is no evidence that he ever strayed from her bed and considerable proof (they had eleven children) that he found it congenial. He early found slavery morally troubling and ultimately regarded it as incompatible with American ideals of liberty. But he died owning slaves. He gained fame as the master of political compromise, which by definition is the bending of principles to achieve functional agreements. But in 1825, he was reviled as crooked, even though he did not violate a single personal scruple or run counter to his own conscience.</p> <p>All lives are marked by such inconsistencies. We strive to reveal Clay to a new generation of readers by showing how he was both exemplary and unique, how he was both mired in the customs of his time and a prophet for ideas that would not gain acceptance until our own. He believed in ideas with passion, but he leavened everything with humor, a novelty among public figures of his time and obviously one of the facets that Abraham Lincoln found appealing enough to imitate. Most of all, we found that there has never been anyone like Clay in American political history. He transformed the post of Speaker of the House into its modern role, he proposed and doggedly advocated a plan to expand American prosperity, and he was a crucial leader in every matter great and small bearing upon American politics for almost fifty years.</p> <p>When our friend made that crack about the &#x201c;Corrupt Bargain,&#x201d; we all laughed, but we shouldn&#x2019;t have. In a way, this book is our penance for having done so, because Henry Clay was a patriot, a statesman, and a gentleman. Not without flaws, he was nevertheless about as good as it gets in public life, and we hope that readers will find him as fascinating as we have.</p> <br>David S. Heidler and Jeanne T.

Abridged for the modern reader.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Augustine's <i>City of God,</i> a monumental work of religious lore, philosophy, and history, was written as a kind of literary tombstone for Roman culture. After the sack of Rome, Augustine wrote this book to anatomize the corruption of Romans' pursuit of earthly pleasures: "grasping for praise, open-handed with their money; honest in the pursuit of wealth, they wanted to hoard glory." Augustine contrasts his condemnation of Rome with an exaltation of Christian culture. The glory that Rome failed to attain will only be realized by citizens of the City of God, the Heavenly Jerusalem foreseen in Revelation. Because <i>City of God</i> was written for men of classical learning--custodians of the culture Augustine sought to condemn--it is thick with Ciceronian circumlocutions, and makes many stark contrasts between "Your Virgil" and "Our Scriptures." Even if Augustine's prose strikes modern ears as a bit bombastic, and if his polarized Christian/pagan world is more binary than the one we live in today, his arguments against utopianism and his defense of the richness of Christian culture remain useful and strong. <i>City of God</i> is, as its final words proclaim itself to be, "a giant of a book." <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>St. Augustine&#39;s masterpiece is an interpretation of history in terms of the struggle between good and evil: the City of God in conflict with the City of the Devil.

For more information about Joseph, please visit his website www.josephbruchac.com.Kindergarten-Grade 4-- The book opens with an Abenaki storyteller explaining to his grandson that just as there are always 13 scales on ``Old Turtle's back,'' there are 13 moons in a year, each of which has a name and a story. The poetic tales and corresponding paintings that follow represent myths or legends of different Native American tribes. Although the language of these poems is not particularly memorable or childlike, it does evoke images and passes on some of the traditions of the native people and their closeness to the natural world. The cadence is that of an adult explaining things to a child. Both text and illustrations have a distancing effect on readers. Locker's large, dark paintings stand parallel to or in tandem with the poems but are not integral to them. They create a mood and capture portions of the text, encouraging viewers to look ``at'' rather than ``into'' these images. There is a sense of vastness in these paintings, and sometimes a harshness, but little of the lushness or the warmth of the land. Although the cover illustration of the turtle is inviting and the large format attractive, these are poems that will probably not entice most youngsters on their own. They can be appreciated, however, when presented by an adult and will be a welcome addition to units on Native American cultures. --Kay E.

A larger fleet had never before been assembled. In the Voyage of the Armada, David Howarth brilliantly conveys the drama of the Spanish Armada's progress and brings to life the personalities of the men who influenced its course, from the dogmatic and irrational Philip II to Don Juan Martinez de Recalde to Don Pedro and Don Diego de Valdes, who were cousins but also bitter enemies, to the Spanish soldiers and sailors who unquestioningly ventured into unknown seas to confront their fates. Basing his narrative on previously unexplored Spanish sources, David Howarth shows that there is always another side to every conflict. The Voyage of the Armada recounts the adventures of these brave men as they go from battles to storms to wrecks and then finally - for the lucky ones - return home.

In peacetime he remained in Shetland, and it was then that he started his writing career. Some of his books include The Shetland Bus, Dawn of D-Day. and Waterloo: A Near Run Thing. David Howarth died in 1991, at the age of 78.</p><h2>Three Steps to Awakening: A Practice for Bringing Mindfulness to Life</h2><p><b>A unique three-phase model for meditation practice that ties together elements of the various Buddhist traditions and that is remarkably adaptable to modern life and changing situations.<br><br></b>This book represents the distillation of Larry Rosenberg's more than forty years of teaching. Drawing on the various Buddhist traditions in which he has practiced, he describes three subtly different but complementary forms of meditation practice: (1) breath awareness, (2) breath as anchor, and (3) choiceless awareness.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having the three methods in one's repertoire gives one meditation resources for any life situation. In a time of stress, for example, one might use breath awareness exclusively. Or on an extended retreat, one might find choiceless awareness more appropriate. The three-step method has been taught to Larry's students at the Cambridge Meditation Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for many years.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After teaching the three-step method, Larry goes on to show how to bring the awareness gained in meditation to the world off the cushion, into relationships and into all areas of daily life.</p><p>LARRY ROSENBERG is founder and resident teacher of the Cambridge Insight Meditation Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and a guiding teacher at the Insight Meditation Society in Barre, Massachusetts."In <i>Three Steps to Awakening</i>, Rosenberg distills decades of his experience into three essential meditation practices designed to aid in any life situation.&nbsp; Reading it is like being with Rosenberg in person, and the clarity with which he details each practice makes it an exceptional companion for the aspiring meditator."&#x2014;<i>Buddhadharma</i><br><br>"For those who seek clear, wise guidance in the &#x2018;how to&#x2019;s&#x2019; of Buddhist meditation, Larry Rosenberg&#x2019;s new book will become a valued resource.&nbsp; Written with great simplicity, intelligence and warmth,<i> Three Steps to Awakening</i> introduces core practices that together constitute a vibrantly alive spiritual path.&#x201d;&#x2014;Tara Brach, PhD, author of <i>Radical Acceptance</i> and <i>True Refuge<br><br></i>"Larry Rosenberg offers us a practice that, although based on the Anapanasati Sutta of the Buddha, is honed from his own realization and thus holds the pragmatism of his decades of meditation and teaching.&nbsp; He does not stop with formal instructions but encourages us forward beyond special forms and environment and drops us off at the gateway of our lives. Larry calls himself a minimalist, and it is because he gives us only what is relevant, so that we can move easily with his teaching toward the liberation of our own minds and hearts.&#x201d;&#x2014; Rodney Smith, author of <i>Stepping Out of Self Deception</i> and <i>Awakening</i></p><h2>Francine Poulet Meets the Ghost Raccoon: Tales from Deckawoo Drive, Volume Two</h2><p><b>Deckawoo Drive&#x2019;s intrepid animal control officer meets her match&#x2014;or does she?

Jimmy had run up after her, right in front of<br>everyone and God, grabbed her elbow, and said she didn&#x2019;t see what she thought<br>she saw. And Diane stopped walking, put her hands to the tops of her flared<br>Lee&#x2019;s, wearing a thin yellow halter and clogs, big hoop earrings, and Dr<br>Pepper&#x2013;flavored lipstick. She wanted Jimmy to see what he was missing just<br>because a six-pack of Coors had clouded his brain and he&#x2019;d jumped at the<br>cheapest tail he could find on the Jericho Square.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I swear. She just crawled on top of me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Here, would you hold something for me?&#x201d; Diane said.<br><br>Jimmy smiled and nodded. Diane shot him her middle finger, turned on a<br>heel, and walked through the Square toward the big gazebo, all lit up for the<br>celebration, a band playing a half-decent version of &#x201c;Freebird.&#x201d; There were a<br>lot of old men and young men hanging out in folding chairs and folding tables,<br>big metal barbecue pits blowing smoke off chicken and ribs, talking about<br>Saigon and the Battle of the Bulge. The town aldermen had called it a celebration<br>of Tibbehah County&#x2019;s &#x201c;Contribution to Freedom.&#x201d; Damn, Diane just<br>wanted the hell out of there to go smoke a cigarette and settle in and watch<br>Johnny Carson before her father, a Pentecostal minister, told her to turn off<br>that Hollywood filth.<br><br>He was never much fun. He didn&#x2019;t even laugh when Johnny had on those<br>animals who would crap on his desk.<br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get a ride,&#x201d; Lori said. Damn, she&#x2019;d never forget that, Lori not wanting<br>to walk the two miles home. Diane remembered being mad at Jimmy in<br>that seventeen-year-old heartbreak way, but also feeling the freedom of the<br>summer and a night like the Fourth of July when Jericho actually felt like a<br>place she wanted to be, with the music and good-smelling food and cold watermelon.<br><br>All the boys with their big shiny trucks and muscle cars circling the<br>Square like sharks, revving their motors, tooting their horns, and trying to get<br>Diane and Lori inside like some kind of trophies for the boy parade.<br><br>&#x201c;We could see the fireworks,&#x201d; Lori said. &#x201c;After that, lots of people would<br>give us rides.&#x201d;<br><br>Lori was three years younger and lots less developed, still sort of gawky,<br>with her plastic glasses and braces, hair feathered back, wearing a tight Fleet-<br>wood Mac T-shirt, ass-hugging bell-bottoms, and clogs identical to Diane&#x2019;s.<br>Diane and Lori had lived next door to each other since they&#x2019;d been born, and<br>Diane for a long time felt like the mother before she became the big sister. She<br>was glad that Lori saw that shit with Jimmy. She wanted Lori to know a girl<br>didn&#x2019;t get treated like toilet paper, no matter if Jimmy was a senior and that his<br>dad owned the big lumber mill and had bought him that red Pontiac for his<br>birthday. You didn&#x2019;t take a goddamn tramp thrown in your face.<br><br>&#x201c;I never liked that bastard anyway.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The way he&#x2019;s always brushing his hair, thinking he&#x2019;s pretty,&#x201d; Lori said.<br>&#x201c;Talks down to me like I&#x2019;m a kid. Like when he comes over on Sunday before<br>your parents get home and he tells me to get lost. Who talks to someone like<br>that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a real jackass.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe this would make us feel better,&#x201d; Lori said, stopping in front of the<br>closed storefront of Snooky Williams&#x2019; Insurance, opening her purse and showing<br>Diane a little baggie with a couple joints in it. &#x201c;I stole them from my<br>mom. She won&#x2019;t say anything because she doesn&#x2019;t think I know about her liking<br>to smoke.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Lori?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; she said, as they walked side by side around the shops, the Tibbehah<br>Monitor, the old laundromat, Kaye&#x2019;s Western Wear, and the old Rexall Drugs.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re my hero,&#x201d; she said.<br>Around the Square, the old movie marquee showed The Exorcist II still.<br><br>They wouldn&#x2019;t be getting that Star Wars movie for another two years. They<br>turned away from the big celebration and followed Cotton Road to the west,<br>out of town and into the country, and the little houses off County Road 234<br>where they lived. They made the walk a lot of days, sometimes coming into the<br>Rexall for milk shakes or ice cream, mainly to meet up when there wasn&#x2019;t<br>much to do, before Diane had taken that afternoon job at the Dairy Queen off<br>Highway 45. Something else that her dad didn&#x2019;t like, again saying she&#x2019;d come<br>into highway trash. Diane thinking he must have a whole system of how to<br>divide trashy people by geography.<br><br>The music was still loud coming from the Square a quarter mile away as<br>they walked through people&#x2019;s yards and little gullies and on the soft gravel<br>shoulder of the road. Headlights popped up only every few minutes, and they&#x2019;d<br>walk into shadows and away from the road when a car would be coming up<br>on them from town. When they got to the creek bridge, just a little concrete<br>span, they walked down the bank, a hell of a lot easier when they took off their<br>clogs and didn&#x2019;t slide. There was a big flat rock where they could jump over<br>the shallow sandy creek. They used to come here a lot as kids and play and<br>watch the old men fish. Lori&#x2019;s stepfather and Diane&#x2019;s dad had been friends for<br>a while but had a falling-out when Lori&#x2019;s parents had left the church and become<br>Methodists.<br><br>Lori pulled out a joint and lit it with a matchbook from the Rebel Truck<br>Stop. She sucked on it a few moments, coughed out most of the smoke, and<br>smiled as she passed it.<br><br>&#x201c;Listen,&#x201d; Diane said, straining to hear the music off the Square. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s<br>that song?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c; &#x2018;My Name Is Lisa.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Diane said, taking a long pull. &#x201c;Yes. Jessi Colter. God damn, I love<br>Jess Colter.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Anyone ever tell you that you favor her?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jess Colter?&#x201d; Diane said. &#x201c;Um, no. You can&#x2019;t be high yet.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re dark like her,&#x201d; Lori said. &#x201c;And the way you do your hair, all black<br>and feathered. Makes you look like an Indian.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am part Indian,&#x201d; Diane said. &#x201c;On my momma&#x2019;s side. Her daddy was full<br>Cherokee.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You never told me that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My daddy says it&#x2019;s an embarrassment to have Indian blood,&#x201d; Diane said.<br>&#x201c;He said those people were godless and did nothing but worship trees and<br>rocks.&#x201d;<br><br>Lori passed back the joint. There was a very large moon that night and a<br>lot of stars, the rock where they sat still warm from the hot summer days. They<br>both heard cracks off in the distance and both turned to the sky above Jericho<br>thinking that the fireworks had started.<br><br>&#x201c;Shit,&#x201d; Diane said. &#x201c;Just some rednecks shooting off pistols. Every Christmas<br>and Fourth of July they got to make a lot of noise and raise hell. They&#x2019;ll<br>be shooting all night long.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You think we can see the fireworks from here?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; Diane said. &#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; Diane reached into her purse and pulled<br>out a pint of Aristocrat Vodka and took a swig.<br><br>&#x201c;Are we both going to hell?&#x201d; Lori asked. She said it with a great deal of<br>seriousness, spending way too much time as a kid at Diane&#x2019;s daddy&#x2019;s church.<br><br>&#x201c;All I really know, Lori, is that I don&#x2019;t want to be like my dad or even my<br>mother,&#x201d; Diane said. &#x201c;What they do is not living. It&#x2019;s preparing to die. My dad<br>won&#x2019;t be satisfied until he&#x2019;s fitted into his coffin, waiting to take the journey to<br>heaven to square-dance and drink apple juice.&#x201d;<br><br>Lori laughed so hard, she spit out a little vodka. Diane smoked the joint, the<br>idea of Jimmy making her laugh, too. The hair, all that goddamn blond hair,<br>and that little joke of a mustache. He thought he looked like Burt Reynolds<br>but really looked like he&#x2019;d forgotten to wipe his face.<br><br>After a while under the moon, and finding warmth on that hot rock, they<br>finished the joint and a lot of the vodka and walked back up the hill to the<br>road. They slid into their clogs and laughed and walked over the bridge, a big<br>expanse of cattle land stretching out to the north of them, cows grouped under<br>shade trees as if they couldn&#x2019;t tell when the sun had gone down, and a gathering<br>of trailers and little houses every quarter mile or so. Their road wasn&#x2019;t<br>too far, a turn at Varner&#x2019;s Quick Mart and about a half mile beyond that into<br>the hills. Diane would have to run straight to the bathroom to get off the<br>smoke smell and brush her teeth, she could guarantee the pastor would be<br>checking on her before he turned in from his nightly Bible readings at the kitchen<br>table. And if he started in on her again, the animated yelling and screaming,<br>her mother would be just assured to be back in their bedroom covered up<br>and hiding, waiting to be bright-faced and beaming in the morning as if the<br>words hadn&#x2019;t been said.<br><br>They were about a quarter mile past the bridge, laughing and talking,<br>planning some kind of revenge for Jimmy, learning of two boys that Lori<br>thought she could get once her braces came off, and deciding that if it came<br>down to Jan-Michael Vincent and Parker Stevenson, that Parker seemed to be<br>much smarter and better-looking. They both liked how he handled himself on<br>the Battle of the Network Stars.<br><br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br><br>Diane turned and looked over her shoulder, walking kind of sloppy on the<br>gravel, not caring to move back off the highway. &#x201c;Who cares?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re slowing down.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Shit,&#x201d; Diane said. &#x201c;Probably Jimmy wanting to explain how it was really<br>that tramp&#x2019;s fault for jumping into his backseat and starting to make out.&#x201d;<br><br>The car had slowed to a crawl, but when she looked back again, she didn&#x2019;t<br>see those telltale cat eyes of the Trans Am. This was a bigger car, black, probably<br>a Chevy, with big headlights that switched onto bright and blinded them<br>a bit, the engine in neutral and growling.<br><br>&#x201c;Fucking asshole!&#x201d; Diane yelled.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Lori said. &#x201c;Fucking asshole!&#x201d;<br><br>The engine growled again, leaving the high beams on, following them slow<br>and steady. The creep really getting on Diane&#x2019;s nerves. She waved for the car<br>to move on, and when that didn&#x2019;t work, raised her right hand high and shot the<br>bird. The driver revved the engine and blasted up ahead of them and then just<br>as fast hit the brakes hard. The car idled in the hot summer air up in the high<br>gentle curve of the country road, the exhaust chugging, taillights glowing red.<br><br>&#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t have done that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Someone is just messing with us,&#x201d; Diane said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not scared.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Me either,&#x201d; Lori said. &#x201c;Fuck you, man!&#x201d;<br><br>They laughed and kept walking, waiting for the car to speed off, but instead<br>it just sat there maybe forty yards away, and then the driver shot the car into<br>reverse, heading back for them. The girls jumped off the shoulder and found<br>themselves caught between the road and a long barbed wire fence. Diane felt<br>the fence poking and catching her top and biting into her side. &#x201c;Goddamn son<br>of a bitch.&#x201d;<br><br>The car was a Chevy, a black Monte Carlo, and it waited at the roadside,<br>both of the girls stuck down between the gulley and the road. Diane grabbed<br>Lori&#x2019;s hand and told her to be quiet and just walk, and they followed the road<br>as the Monte Carlo drove slow alongside of them. Revving the motor every few<br>seconds, Diane now scared, scared as hell, because she didn&#x2019;t know this car or<br>the driver and knew they were still a good ways from Varner&#x2019;s, where they<br>could call someone, or scream near some trailers, and not be hanging out here<br>in the night.

She could not see the driver but caught<br>part of his face when he fired up a cigarette and said, &#x201c;You little dolls want a<br>ride?&#x201d; In half shadow, he was black and wore a beard, she could see, a jean<br>jacket collar popped around his neck, something wrong with his skin, as if<br>some of it had been burned at one time. The lighter went out and the girls kept<br>walking. She held Lori&#x2019;s hand tighter. The younger girl was trembling and<br>staring at the ground. That proud, sexy strut from the Square was gone; now<br>it was fast and shameful and following that barbed wire path, her muttering<br>that she should never ever have taken those joints, that they shouldn&#x2019;t have<br>been drinking and messing about.<br><br>&#x201c;Hush,&#x201d; Diane said. &#x201c;Just hush.&#x201d;<br><br>The Monte Carlo revved. The man followed them slow but didn&#x2019;t say another<br>word. Diane thought maybe they could run, but running might make it<br>worse, show the man they were scared, although he probably already knew it<br>and liked it.<br><br>When an old truck passed them on the road, one headlight busted out, and<br>heading to town, the girls ran up to the side of the road and waved and yelled,<br>but the truck just kept on puttering by them, leaving them full out exposed in<br>the headlights of the Monte Carlo and caught in the high beams. As the old<br>truck disappeared over the hill, there was still the sound of the big party, a mile<br>away, playing some Tanya Tucker. &#x201c;Delta Dawn.&#x201d;<br><br>Diane held on to Lori&#x2019;s hand tighter.<br><br>The driver&#x2019;s door opened and the shadow of the man appeared behind the<br>lights. Diane tried to shield her eyes and yelled for the man to get the hell away<br>from both of them. Lori was crying. And that made Diane madder than anything.<br>&#x201c;What the fuck do you want?&#x201d;<br><br>The man had a gun and was upon them faster than Diane would have<br>thought possible, snatching up a good hunk of her hair and forcing her back to &nbsp;<br>his car. She screamed as loud as she could. Lori could have run. She could have<br>run. Diane yelled so much she felt her lungs might explode.<br><br>The car door slammed behind them just as the fireworks started above, coloring<br>their windshield in wild patterns, and the man sped off to the west.

S. Internal Revenue Code has been ridiculed, feared and despised by virtually everyone. And why not? As presented by the Internal Revenue Service, the code appears illogical, inconsistent and incomprehensible. As presented, the code defies practically the entire Bill of Rights: requiring citizens to testify against themselves, allowing searches and seizures without warrants, levying fines and penalties without trials and imposing a tax on the basic right to earn a living. As presented, the IRC would appear to turn everything we all thought we had learned in grade school English and Civics on its head. Is it possible that we all just misunderstood those simple lessons? Maybe. But researcher, analyst and scholar Peter E. Hendrickson believes that after Cracking the Code, you&#39;ll agree that what has been misunderstood is the 3,413,780 word monstrosity itself--and how, and to whom, it applies. Hendrickson delves deep into the history, statutes and case law behind the Code to reveal its startling and liberating secrets; and unless you live in a cave, you need to know what he has uncovered. Once you&#39;ve finished Cracking the Code, the tax laws will never mean the same thing to you, or your bank account, again!</p><p></p><h2>First Day Jitters</h2><p>&#34;Funny and insightful...

Uneasy in the midst of the malevolent Unseelie Court, pixie Kaye is sure of only one thing -- her love for Roiben. But when Kaye, drunk on faerie wine, declares herself to Roiben, he sends her on a seemingly impossible quest. Now Kaye can't see or speak to Roiben unless she can find the one thing she knows doesn't exist: a faerie who can tell a lie. <br> <br> Miserable and convinced she belongs nowhere, Kaye decides to tell her mother the truth -- that she is a changeling left in place of the human daughter stolen long ago. Her mother's shock and horror sends Kaye back to the world of Faerie to find her human counterpart and return her to Ironside. But once back in the faerie courts, Kaye finds herself a pawn in the games of Silarial, queen of the Seelie Court. Silarial wants Roiben's throne, and she will use Kaye, and any means necessary, to get it. In this game of wits and weapons, can a pixie outplay a queen? <br> <br> Holly Black spins a seductive tale at once achingly real and chillingly enchanted, set in a dangerous world where pleasure mingles with pain and nothing is exactly as it appears.</p><p>Holly Black is the author of bestselling contemporary fantasy books for kids and teens.

In this follow-up to Black's previous two books about the urban fey, Kaye and her gay friend Corny (from Tithe, 2003) meet brothers Luis and Dave (from Valiant, 2005),&nbsp;and the teens are caught in the middle&nbsp;of a clash between&nbsp;the rival faery courts. As characters struggle to shape their identities, quintessential coming-of-age themes are as skillfully interwoven as in the earlier adventures, as are seductive contradictions: faeries&nbsp;who cannot lie nonetheless find ways to&nbsp;connive and betray, loyalty and love are wielded as weapons, and ethereal beauty&nbsp;often masks cruelty of the ugliest sort.

The first half of the twentieth century was a period of great turmoil in China. <i>Family,</i> one of the most popular Chinese novels of that time, vividly reflects that turmoil and serves as a basis for understanding what followed. Written in 1931, <i>Family</i> has been compared to <i>Dream of the Red Chamber</i> for its superb portrayal of the family life and society of its time. Drawn largely from Pa Chin's own experience, <i>Family</i> is the story of the Kao family compound, consisting of four generations plus servants. It is essentially a picture of the conflict between old China and the new tide rising to destroy it, as manifested in the daily lives of the Kao family, and particularly the three young Kao brothers. Here we see situations that, unique as they are to the time and place of this novel, recall many circumstances of today's world: the conflict between generations and classes, ill-fated love affairs, students' political activities, and the struggle for the liberation of women. The complex passions aroused in <i>Family</i> and in the reader are an indication of the universality of human experience. This novel illustrates the effectiveness of fiction as a vehicle for translating the experience of one culture to another very different one.</p><p>Titles of related interest from Waveland Press: Fingarette, Confucius: The Secular as Sacred (ISBN 9781577660101); and Heinz, Asian Cultural Traditions (ISBN 9781577660439).Pa Chin (Li Fei-kan) is one of the most outstanding figures of modern Chinese literature. He was very popular in China during the 1930s and 1940s, especially among the youth who were increasingly influential in Chinese political life in the twentieth century.

Seattle police officer Ben Weston and his family--with the exception of the youngest son-- are brutally slaughtered at a critical point in Weston's undercover probe of youth gang activity. Several suspicious student loans are traced to Weston and members of the gangs he was investigating. In his 10th appearance, narrator and fellow cop J. P. "Beau" Beaumont vows to avenge his friend's death, meanwhile protecting the five-year-old survivor (and sole witness) and slowly realizing that the murder has little to do with student loans; he discovers dirty politics and graft reaching far into the department. Jance demands a lot from her readers: the likeliest suspects are completely hidden for a third of the tale, the loan angle makes little sense and the unconvincingly macho Beau never quite gels. Yet the shocks delivered as the villains are gradually unveiled and as Beaumont and pals try to keep the little boy alive resonate deeply.

All she has to do is become an expert bounty hunter overnight-and keep herself from getting killed before she gets her man...<br></p><p>Stephanie Plum is so smart, so honest, and so funny that her narrative charm could drive a documentary on termites. But this tough gal from New Jersey, an unemployed discount lingerie buyer, has a much more interesting story to tell: She has to say that her Miata has been repossessed and that she's so poor at the moment that she just drank her last bottle of beer for breakfast. She has to say that her only chance out of her present rut is her repugnant cousin Vinnie and his bail-bond business. She has to say that she blackmailed Vinnie into giving her a bail-bond recovery job worth $10,000 (for a murder suspect), even though she doesn't own a gun and has never apprehended a person in her life. And she has to say that the guy she has to get, Joe Morelli, is the same creep who charmed away her teenage virginity behind the pastry case in the Trenton bakery where she worked after school.<p> If that hard-luck story doesn't sound compelling enough, Stephanie's several unsuccessful attempts at pulling in Joe make a downright hilarious and suspenseful tale of murder and deceit. Along the way, several more outlandish (but unrelentingly real) characters join the story, including Benito Ramirez, a champion boxer who seems to be following Stephanie Plum wherever she goes.</p><p> Janet Evanovich shares an authentic feel for the streets of Trenton in her debut mystery (she developed her talents in a string of romance novels before creating Ms. Plum), and her tough, frank, and funny first-person narrator offers a winning mix of vulgarity and sensitivity. Evanovich is certainly among the best of the new voices to emerge in the mystery field of the 1990s. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING AUTHOR<br>JANET EVANOVICH<br><br>ONE FOR THE MONEY<br>A Stephanie Plum Novel<br><br>"Comes roaring in like a blast of very fresh air...Goes down like a tall, cool, drink."<br>-<i>The Washington Post</i><br><br>READ THE DYNAMITE BLOCKBUSTER THAT STARTED IT ALL!<br><br>"Snappily written, fast paced and witty."<br>-<i>USA Today</i><br><br>ONE FINE MESS<br>Welcome to Trenton, New Jersey, home to wiseguys, average Joes, and Stephanie Plum, who sports a big attitude and even bigger money problems (since losing her job as a lingerie buyer for a department store).

This instant classic is the story of an intransigent young architect, his violent battle against conventional standards, and his explosive love affair with a beautiful woman who struggles to defeat him. This edition contains a special Afterword by Rand&#39;s literary executor, Leonard Peikoff, which includes excerpts from Ayn Rands&#39; own notes on the making of &#34;The Fountainhead.&#34; As fresh today as it was then, here is a novel about a hero - and about those who try to destroy him.</p><p><i>The Fountainhead</i> has become an enduring piece of literature, more popular now than when published in 1943. On the surface, it is a story of one man, Howard Roark, and his struggles as an architect in the face of a successful rival, Peter Keating, and a newspaper columnist, Ellsworth Toohey. But the book addresses a number of universal themes: the strength of the individual, the tug between good and evil, the threat of fascism. The confrontation of those themes, along with the amazing stroke of Rand's writing, combine to give this book its enduring influence.Ayn Rand is the author of <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>. Her first novel, <i>We the Living</i>, was published in 1936, followed by <i>Anthem</i>. With the publication of <i>The Fountainhead</i> in 1943, she achieved a spectacular and enduring success.

As a Korean-American, Judy understands how to make&nbsp;dishes that may seem exotic and difficult accessible to the everyday cook. The book has over 100 recipes including well-loved dishes like kimchi, sweet potato noodles (<i>japchae</i>), beef and vegetable rice bowl (<i>bibimbap</i>), and Korean fried chicken, along with creative, less-traditional recipes like Spicy Pork Belly Cheese Steak, Krazy Korean Burgers, and Fried Fish with Kimchi Mayo and Sesame Mushy Peas. In addition, there are chapters devoted to sauces, desserts, and drinks as well as a detailed list for stocking a Korean pantry, making this book a comprehensive guide on Korean food and flavors. Enjoying the spotlight as the hot Asian cuisine, Korean food is on the rise, and Judy&#x2019;s bold and exciting recipes are go-tos for making it at home.<br>&nbsp;<br></p><p>JUDY JOO is a French-trained Korean-American chef, writer, and restaurateur whose culinary expertise spans the globe. Ushering Korean flavors into home kitchens, Judy hosts Cooking Channel&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Korean Food Made Simple</i>&nbsp;and is a regular on Food Network.&#x201c;This is a stunning book. Forget for a moment it's about the food of Korea. It's just so impressive on many levels. I already crave the Disco fries and Korean eggplant and I won't rest until I have the Korean fried chicken! Judy has written a beautiful, timely, and truly impressive tome, both mouthwatering and so very informative. Julia Child just got a new and wonderful neighbor on my bookshelf.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<b>Geoffrey Zakarian, Iron Chef</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The tantalizing flavors and techniques of Korean food are just beginning to find their way into our home kitchens. Judy Joo is the perfect teacher to lead us into this exciting new world. Get ready for fireworks on your taste buds.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<b>Bobby Flay, chef and author</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;For those of us not lucky enough to have been raised by a Korean mom whom we can rely on to give us a tight recipe for a childhood favorite, there is Judy Joo's <i>Korean Food Made Simple</i>. Informative explanations of the Korean pantry, easy to follow recipes, and beautiful photographs will make this your go-to book for Korean cooking.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<b>Andy Ricker</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Judy Joo is an authority on authentic Korean and American-Korean food. My wife is half Korean so it&#x2019;s important we celebrate the culture and traditions together and with our kids. Judy&#x2019;s new book is a refreshing source of inspiration and information that&#x2019;s open on our bench top every time we cook Korean food.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<b>Chef Curtis Stone, internationally known chef and chef/owner of Maude Restaurant, Beverly Hills</b><br><br> "From kimchi to bibimbap, Joo&#x2014;who hosts a show on the Cooking Channel&#x2014;breaks down intimidating dishes."<br> &#x2014;<b><i>Entertainment Weekly</i></b><br><br> "Korean American chef Joo&#x2019;s debut shares a name with her TV show on the Cooking Channel. After introducing familiar and exotic pantry staples, from nutty toasted sesame oil to fiery Korean chile paste, Joo presents 130 recipes that blend traditional Korean home cooking with contemporary and fusion fare. Assorted kimchi and pickles (cubed radish kimchi) can have long fermentation times, but they&#x2019;re easy to prepare, as are quick stir fries (pork belly and kimchi stir-fry with tofu), soups (instant noodles with spicy rice cakes and fish cakes), and desserts (red bean ice pops). The book also features chapters on sauces, breads, and drinks.VERDICT Like Maangchi&#x2019;s Real Korean Cooking, this cookbook is an approachable gateway to a popular cuisine. Comparatively, Joo&#x2019;s recipes are fancier, with more nods to Western palates (think: cheesecakes, �cheesesteaks, wings, and tacos). Highly recommended." &#x2014;<i><b>Library Journal</b></i><br><br> "Joo, host of the Cooking Channel&#x2019;s Korean Food Made Simple, brings her unique style to Korean cuisine in this delightful and original book. Joo was raised in New Jersey by Korean parents and trained at the French Culinary Institute, and <b>her recipes reflect this fusion of cultures and flavors</b>. Her main focus remains on Korean cuisine, but she adds her own modern twists to reflect her complex palate. Kimchi pulled-pork disco fries, ultimate KFC (Korean fried chicken), and kimchi and bacon brioche are just a few examples of her appealing innovations. She provides a useful section on pantry staples and includes recipes for essential components of many Korean meals, including kimchi, pancakes, and dumplings. Crispy anchovies, kimchi fried rice, and &#x201c;krazy&#x201d; Korean burgers (made with ginger, pancetta, soybean paste, and seltzer) exemplify the wide range of combinations that Joo embraces. Soy-glazed tofu salad, &#x201c;magical&#x201d; chicken ginseng soup, and spicy pork belly cheesesteak are all big on flavor and use easy-to-find ingredients. Joo notes that traditional Korean desserts don&#x2019;t translate well to a Western palate, <b>so she&#x2019;s revamped traditional offerings to create tempting combinations </b>such as caramel doenjang ice cream, spicy molten chocolate lava cakes, seaweed shortbread, and Korean coffee brownies. <b>Cooks looking to make a first foray into Korean cooking or those wishing to enhance their knowledge will delight in Joo&#x2019;s uncommon approach and her tasty creations</b>."<br> &#x2014;<i><b>Publishers Weekly</b></i><br><br>"Judy Joo&#x2019;s <i>Korean Food Made Simple</i> is going to be a big cookbook this year...

Novels and poetry followed, but it was with the story collection <i>Winesburg, Ohio </i>that he found his ideal form, remaking the American short story for the modern era. Hart Crane, one of the first to recognize Anderson&#x2019;s genius, quickly hailed his accomplishment: &#x201c;America should read this book on her knees.&#x201d; Here&#x2013;&#x2013;for the first time in a single volume&#x2013;&#x2013;are all the collections Anderson published during his lifetime: <i>Winesburg, Ohio </i>(1919), <i>The Triumph of</i> <i>the Egg </i>(1921), <i>Horses and Men </i>(1923), and <i>Death in the</i> <i>Woods </i>(1933), along with a generous selection of stories left uncollected or unpublished at his death. Exploring the hidden recesses of small town life, these haunting, understated, often sexually frank stories pivot on seemingly quiet moments when lives change, futures are recast, and pasts come to reckon.

With a new Introduction by Keith Donohue</p></p><p><b>Flann O'Brien</b> is the pseudonym of Brian O'Nolan, an Irish novelist and political commentator who was born in 1911 in County Tyrone and raised in Dublin. He entered the Irish civil service in 1937 and formally retired in 1953. From 1940 until his death, he wrote a political column called "Cruiskeen Lawn" for <i>The Irish Times</i>, under the pseudonym of Myles na Gopaleen; his biting, satiric commentaries made him the conscience of the Irish government. He died in 1966.I N T R O D U C T I O N<br>--<br>'I considered it desirable that he should know nothing about me but it was even better if he knew several things which were quite wrong.' So says the eccentric unnamed narrator of The Third Policeman, lost in a strange land, deliberately shielding his identity and true nature. The desire for self-effacement persists among all of the crazy narrators in Flann O'Brien's five novels, and perhaps it is key to understanding the man behind the novel, who has hidden himself as well under a penname. For the very first thing to know about Flann O'Brien is that he is one of the creations of Brian O'Nolan.<br><br>And there are more than one of him. Beginning in his college days and continuing on to the end of his life, O'Nolan was a serial pseudonymist, but we need only concern ourselves with two. In addition to Flann, the quondam author of the breathtaking At Swim-Two-Birds, The Third Policeman, The Hard Life, and The Dalkey Archive, there is Myles na gCopaleen, author of An Be�al Bocht (translated as The Poor Mouth), who appeared nearly every day as the first-person narrator of the column 'Cruiskeen Lawn' (The Overflowing Little Jug) in the Irish Times from through. More often than not, Myles was also a character in 'Cruiskeen Lawn,' serving not only as a narrator and jesting anatomist of the social and political life of Dublin, but also as an elusive figure. A man of so many identities that he had none. Variously self-described as the Uncrowned King of Ireland, the archetypical Dublin Man, ageless confidant of everyone from Synge to Joyce, Myles was a cross between the comic stage Irishman embodying every known stereotype and a savage critic of cliche�d language and thinking, bureaucracy, mendacity, and other social foibles. To the intelligentsia of Dublin, however, and habitue�s of the pubs, Myles was a real human being. He's that man in the corner nursing a pint, the fellow under the hat, the person otherwise known as Brian O'Nolan. On occasion, all three persons met in 'Cruiskeen Lawn,' such as this encounter in stimulated by the republication of At Swim-Two-Birds. In his thick mock Dublin accent, Myles says:<br><br>There's stories going round that Flann O'Brien and my good self are wan and the same pairson. I know my own know about that leaper. People has said that I have receded under many disguises in many papers, but nobody on or under this world knows what I have written or can declare on oath what I have not written. <br><br>Receding under many disguises, Flann and Myles and Brian are wan and the same, although all three have their respective roles. However, perhaps Myles is right to say that nobody can know for certain where one identity begins and ends.<br><br>This much is known: Brian O'Nolan was born on October, one of a family of twelve children, in Strabane, Ulster, Ireland. His cradle songs were sung in Irish. His father, Michael Nolan, was an Irish nationalist who met his mother, Agnes Gormley, in an Irish language class. After they married, the Nolans became theO� Nualla�in (the Irish Gaelic form) and in their home Irish was spoken, with English reserved as the language of social intercourse for the outside world. The family led a peripatetic lifestyle before finally settling in Dublin proper in, where Brian was to spend the rest of his life. Brian O'Nolan's bilingualism played an important role in his intellectual and artistic career, and this split - Irish at home, English everywhere else - factors into the practice of masking his identity. The underlying linguistic differences between the two languages and the historic intertextual relationship with English play an integral role in the style and structure of the work done as Flann O'Brien and Myles na gCopaleen.<br><br>But before he was either of those two fellows, Brian O'Nolan entered an English-speaking school at age eleven, and seven years later, in 1929, began his studies at University College, Dublin. There he was to begin his literary career, primarily under the pen-name Brother Barnabas, in the college literary magazine Comhthrom Fe�inne. The fiction of a pen-name allowed Brian not only his highly cherished privacy but also the ability to critique his own humor, by commenting from the refuge of other pen-names on articles and essays he had written as Barnabas. After graduation, O'Nolan continued his shenanigans, aided and abetted by college friends, in the aptly named Blather, a comic magazine, all the while pursuing a master's degree by editing and translating a quite serious anthology on Irish nature poetry. In 1935, he took up a post with the Irish government, where he would remain for nearly eighteen years. Two years later, his father died, and for the next decade, Brian would be the primary provider for the younger children in the O'Nolan family.<br><br>Perhaps the suddenness of this domestic burden caused him to focus on the novel he had been tinkering with since his college days. By 1938, he had completed a draft of At Swim-Two-Birds, and on the strength of novelist Graham Greene's enthusiasm, it was accepted by Longmans, Green &amp; Co. for publication the following year. With this triumph in hand, O'Nolan turned his attention to other literary matters, beginning in October with a letter to the editor of the Irish Times, signed by Flann O'Brien. Joining the contretemps between Sean O� Faola�in and Frank O'Connor, O'Brien pointed to the absurdity of the literary feud, and his letter drew fire from both writers. His friend Niall Sheridan described the flood opened by this first chink in the dam:<br><br>Writing under several different names, he proceeded to carry on furious arguments on many topics, satirizing en passant almost every established literary figure. Before long, many notable personalities joined the m�l�e and the whole affair exploded into a giant display of fireworks, a mixture of satire, polemics, criticism, savage invective, and sheer nonsense.<br><br>This extraordinary letter-writing campaign, with its wildly named participants, was carried out over two full years until the Irish Times offered its instigator a column of his own. 'Cruiskeen Lawn' debuted in October 1940, first alternately in Irish and English, but eventually given over entirely to its largely English-speaking audience. The invention of the pen-name Myles na gCopaleen is a nod to a prototypical 'stage Irishman' from a nineteenth-century melodrama, and hiding behind another identity enabled Brian O'Nolan to protect his status in the civil service. Myles would reign as the newspaper's licensed jester and resident wit for the next quarter decade, and many Dubliners began their day by turning first to 'Cruiskeen Lawn' to savor it with the morning tea or the hair of the dog.<br><br><b>At Swim-Two-Birds</b><br>One of the funniest Irish novels of the twentieth century, At Swim-Two-Birds is an exuberant send-up of literature, the novel, and the writer. Holed up in his uncle's Dublin home for the academic year, an unnamed narrator intermittently works on a mock-heroic novel about a man named Dermot Trellis who is, in turn, writing a novel, in which he freely borrows and steals his characters from Irish mythology and folklore, cowboy novels, and whole cloth invention based on the plain people of Ireland, who become strangely more alive while Trellis is asleep. These characters, frustrated by Trellis's authority, set off on a quest to find his son - the product of his union with one of his own characters - whom they commission to write a novel designed to capture, torture, and try Trellis and thus win their freedom.<br><br>At Swim-Two-Birds becomes a twisted Celtic knot, a book that eats its own tail, achieving its humor through parody and play. The figures from Irish mythology and folklore are exaggerated versions of the original and are re-enchanted through O'Brien's preposterous versions. Finn MacCool, the magical giant of pre-Christian Ireland, 'a better man than God,' an Ulsterman, Connachtman, Greek, Cuchulainn, Patrick, his own father and his own son, 'every hero from the crack of time,' becomes the slightly dim-witted storyteller who calls into being another figure from medieval Ireland, Mad Sweeny, who has been cursed to live as a madman in the trees. Seamus Heaney notes that O'Brien gave Sweeny 'a second life, as hilarious as it was melancholy,' and this mixture of whimsy and sorrow told through the madman's poetry works in counterpoint to the third great figure from folklore, the Pooka Mac- Phellimey, a kind of 'devil, third-class,' who spends a fair portion of the book arguing philosophy and kangaroos with the Good Fairy, a 'voice unsupported by a body.' All of these are set off by the ordinary Dubliners - Furriskey, Lamont, and Shanahan - whose splendid conversations accurately capture the banter among friends who circle around the smallest banalities. And laced over all is the narrator's tale, his early introduction to the pleasures of alcohol, his slide to dissolution, and his uncle's regular refrain about the boy's study habits:<br><br>'Tell me this, do you ever open a book at all?' Stories interlock, break free, re-form. At Swim-Two-Birds is a dizzying, slapstick extravaganza that satirizes contemporary Ireland and the overromanticized view of the artist and the novel. As for the last of these, the student narrator overseeing this crazy quilt has the final word. 'A satisfactory novel,' he writes, 'should be a self-evident sham to which the reader could regulate at will the degree of his credulity.' Furthermore, writers should feel free to draw their characters from all of literature. A wealth of references to existing works would acquaint the reader instantaneously with the nature of each character, would obviate tiresome explanations and would effectively preclude mountebanks, upstarts, thimbleriggers and persons of inferior education from an understanding of contemporary literature. O'Brien writes for an audience in on the joke, and he realizes that humor works through displacement and disruption of the conscious surface, like the explosion of a splash sending ripples across the water, which liberates the tension. For all its allusions to topics from Irish nature poetry to speculations on time, the novel is intended as an extended joke and a celebration of the elasticity of stories and the artifice of art. O'Brien's disdain for certain, clear meaning and interpretation took an even more insidious turn in The Third Policeman.<br><br><b>The Third Policeman</b><br>After the structural counterpoint and weaving together of the four major plot strands of At Swim-Two-Birds, O'Brien experimented with another form for his second novel, and the result, The Third Policeman, might best be described as a hallucinatory existential murder mystery, with footnotes.3 As in his first novel, O'Brien's hero is never given a name, and in the course of his journey, comes to realize that he has completely forgotten it in any case. Along the way, he encounters the seeming ghost of the man he has murdered and finds himself in a land of wonders with a police station at its center, run by the irrepressible Sergeant Pluck, who is overly concerned with bicycles, and the equally strange Policeman MacCruiskeen, who spends his time on marvelous inventions, including a mangle that converts light into sound - all in all, a kind of hellish literalization of the wild surmises of our hero's scholarly pursuits. The whole enterprise, as Brian O'Nolan would say, is played for laughs, and the critic Denis Donoghue points out that the narrator's rather affectless reaction to this world is part of a tradition of Irish anatomies of the human comedy, revealing the author's tendency to 'stand aside from the common urgencies of feeling and to treat the whole farrago of sensibility as warranting merely speculative attention.' 4 If that's the dark way to humor and abstraction, a very deep spiritual dread lurks long after the book's surprising conclusion. As Sergeant Pluck has said, 'The particular death you die is not even a death (which is an inferior phenomenon at the best) only an insanitary abstraction in the backyard . . .' As funny as this way of speaking - and this view of life and death - may be, that abstraction in the backyard gives pause.<br><br>What must have given Brian O'Nolan pause was the fact that The Third Policeman was rejected by Longmans and his agents could not find another publisher. To save face, O'Nolan concocted a number of stories about the supposed disappearance of the manuscript, but in truth, by late 1940, he put the book away and no longer sought to publish it in his lifetime. Flann O'Brien fell silent, giving way to the jests and barbs of Myles na gCopaleen. Only in 1967, after O'Nolan's death, was The Third Policeman brought to print and to critical acclaim. One can sadly speculate on the effect such a rejection had on his career as a novelist and the number of novels never written in this innovative, experimental, and extravagant style. 'Cruiskeen Lawn' provided some solace, and Myles produced a number of comic plays, was quoted daily by an admiring public, and was touted in publications such as the New York Herald Tribune and Time magazine as a comic genius. By 1943, the column had grown so popular that the Irish Times brought out an anthology of his best pieces with a facsimile cover of the newspaper's front page announcing in a banner headline: MYLES NA gCOPALEEN CROWNED KING of IRELAND. The anthology of 'Cruiskeen Lawn' was disposed throughout in two parallel columns in English and Irish, and it marked Myles's last attempt to juxtapose and counterpoint the Irish language of his youth with the English that helped expand his audience and refine his sense as a satirist of Dublin life and culture.<br><br><b>The Poor Mouth</b><br>While it was his farewell to his father tongue, his triumph in Irish was An Be�al Bocht, translated into English in 1973 as The Poor Mouth. While every translation suffers from the journey between languages, The Poor Mouth has the added burden of being a parody of the style and substance of Irish Gaelic texts of the Irish literary revival - primarily TomasO� Criomhthain's An tOilea�nach (The Islandman). Strictly speaking, however, O'Nolan's satire is aimed more at those who wanted to romanticize and sentimentalize the Gaelic people and culture, remnants of a dying language and a dying way of life. Despite its wild exaggerations and forays into Irish Gaelic folklore and archetypes, The Poor Mouth is O'Nolan's most naturalistic and empathetic work. The tension between English and Irish, the allure of civilization and the comfort of the primitive, has its final turn in this novel, and the burden of the truly tragic fades, never to reappear in his work. Writing in the New York Times Book Review of the 1973 translation, Brian O'Doherty says An Be�al Bocht was written in a moribund language about a moribund language for a vanishing audience. Yet for almost any Irishman, the language calls up a primary culture, a lucid and devious state of mind to which only the language gives access . . . [yet] O'Brien's very modern ironies give us as much access to that world as anyone who doesn't have Gaelic can get.<br><br>That lucid and devious state of mind for Flann/Myles/Brian began to diminish as well, darkening with the pressure of the column and the job, the drink and disappointment, the depressed state of post-war Dublin and...</p><h2>Since Socrates: A Concise Source Book of Classic Readings</h2><p>Understand and analyze the great historical texts in philosophy with SINCE SOCRATES!

But his self-published volume soon became a landmark of poetry, introducing the world to a new and uniquely American form. The "father of free verse," Whitman drew upon the cadence of simple, even idiomatic speech to "sing" such themes as democracy, sexuality, and frank autobiography.<br><br>Throughout his prolific writing career, Whitman continually revised his work and expanded Leaves of Grass, which went through nine, substantively different editions, culminating in the final, authoritative "Death-bed Edition." Now the original 1855 version and the "<i>Death-bed Edition</i>" of 1892 have been brought together in a single volume, allowing the reader to experience the total scope of Whitman's genius, which produced love lyrics, visionary musings, glimpses of nightmare and ecstasy, celebrations of the human body and spirit, and poems of loneliness, loss, and mourning.<br></p><p>Alive with the mythical strength and vitality that epitomized the American experience in the nineteenth century, Leaves of Grass continues to inspire, uplift, and unite those who read it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Karen Karbiener</b> received a Ph.D. from Columbia University and currently teaches at New York University.

And only Whitman," wrote D. H. Lawrence in 1923. "No English pioneers, no French. No European pioneer-poets. In Europe the would-be pioneers are mere innovators. The same in America. Ahead of Whitman, nothing" (Woodress, ed., <i>Critical Essays on Walt Whitman</i>, p. 211). The sentiments were echoed by the likes of F. O. Matthiessen, William Carlos Williams, and Allen Ginsberg. Langston Hughes named Whitman the "greatest of American poets"; Henry Miller described him as "the bard of the future" (quoted in Perlman et al., eds., <i>Walt Whitman: The Measure of His Song</i>, pp. 185, 205). Even his more cynical readers recognized Whitman&#x2019;s position of near-mythical status and supreme influence in American letters. "His crudity is an exceeding great stench but it is America," Ezra Pound admitted in a 1909 article; he continued: "To be frank, Whitman is to my fatherland what Dante is to Italy" (Perlman, pp. 112 113). "We continue to live in a Whitmanesque age," said Pablo Neruda in a speech to PEN in 1972. "Walt Whitman was the protagonist of a truly geographical personality: The first man in history to speak with a truly continental American voice, to bear a truly American name" (Perlman, p. 232). Alicia Ostriker, in a 1992 essay, claimed that "if women poets in America have written more boldly and experimentally in the last thirty years than our British equivalents, we have Whitman to thank" (Perlman, p. 463).</p><p>How did a former typesetter and penny-daily editor come to write the poems that would define and shape American literature and culture?</p><p>Whitman&#x2019;s metamorphosis in the decade before the first publication of <i>Leaves of Grass</i> in 1855 remains an intriguing mystery. Biographers concede that details about Whitman&#x2019;s life and literary activities from the late 1840s to the early 1850s are extremely hard to come by. "Little is known of Whitman&#x2019;s activities in these years," writes Joann Krieg in the 1851 1854 section of her <i>Whitman Chronology</i> (most other years have month-to-month commentaries). Whitman was fired from his job at the New Orleans <i>Daily Cresent</i> in the summer of 1848, then resigned from his editorship of the <i>Brooklyn Freeman</i> in 1849. Though he continued to write for several newspapers during the next five years, his work as a freelancer was irregular and his whereabouts difficult to follow. He seems also to have tried his hand at several other jobs, including house building and selling stationery. One wonders if Walt&#x2019;s break from the daily work routine had something to do with his poetic awakening. Keeping to a regulated schedule in the newspaper offices had been a struggle for him, and he had been fired several times for laziness or "sloth." Charting his own days and ways in particular, working as a self-employed carpenter, as had his idiosyncratic father may well have enabled him to think "outside the box" and toward the organic, freeform qualities of <i>Leaves</i>.</p><p>Purposefully dropping out of workaday life and common sight suggests that Whitman may have intended to obscure the details of his pre-<i>Leaves</i> years, and there is further evidence to support the idea that Whitman consciously created a "myth of origins." In his biography of Whitman, Justin Kaplan quotes the poet on the mysterious "perturbations" of <i>Leaves of Grass</i>: It had been written under "great pressure, pressure from within," and he had "felt that he must do it" (p. 185). To obscure the roots of <i>Leaves</i> and build the case for his original thinking, Whitman destroyed significant amounts of manuscripts and letters upon at least two occasions; as Grier notes in his introduction to <i>Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</i>, "one is continually struck by [the] omissions and reticences" of the remaining material (vol. 1, p. 8). Indeed, some of the notes surviving his "clean-ups" were reminders to himself to "not name any names" and thus to remain silent concerning any possible readings or influences. "Make no quotations, and no reference to any other writers. Lumber the writing with nothing," Whitman wrote to himself in the late 1840s. It was a command he would repeat to himself several times in the years preceding the publication of <i>Leaves</i>.</p><p>Whitman&#x2019;s friends and critics also did their share to create a legend of the writer and his explosive first book. In the first biographical study of Whitman, John Burroughs claimed that certain individuals throughout history "mark and make new eras, plant the standard again ahead, and in one man personify vast races or sweeping revolutions. I consider Walt Whitman such an individual" (Burroughs, "Preface" to <i>Notes on Walt Whitman as Poet and Person</i>). Others insisted that <i>Leaves of Grass</i> was the product of the "cosmic consciousness" Whitman had acquired around 1850 (Bucke, <i>Walt Whitman</i>, p. 178) or a spiritual "illumination" of the highest order (Binns, <i>A Life of Walt Whitman</i>, p. 69 70).</p><p>What sort of experience could inspire such a personal revelation? For a man just awakening to the inhumanity of slavery and the hidden agendas of the Free Soil stance, witnessing a slave auction might do it. This was but one of the life-altering events that occurred during Whitman&#x2019;s three-month sojourn in New Orleans in 1848. Another, substantiated by his poetry rather than Whitman&#x2019;s own word, was an alleged homosexual affair. Several poems in the sexually charged "Calamus" and "Children of Adam" clusters of 1860 are suggestive of an intense and liberating romance in New Orleans. The manuscript for "Once I Passed Through a Populous City" has the lines "man who wandered with me, there, for love of me, / Day by day, and night by night, we were together." "Man" was changed to "woman" in the final draft of the poem; see <i>Whitman&#x2019;s Manuscripts: Leaves of Grass (1860)</i>, edited by Fredson Bowers, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1955, p. 64. In "I Saw in Louisiana a Live-Oak Growing," the poet describes breaking off a twig of a particularly stately and solitary tree: "Yet it remains to me a curious token, it makes me think of manly love." The emotional release of "coming out" might well explain the spectacular openness and provocative energy of <i>Leaves of Grass</i>; additionally, Whitman&#x2019;s identification of his "outsider status" could have helped spark his empathy for women, Native Americans, and other marginalized groups that are celebrated in the 1855 poems.</p></p><h2>Beyond Blessed: God&#39;s Perfect Plan to Overcome All Financial Stress</h2><p><b>Reach your financial goals and reduce the stress in your life with this book of biblical principles by the bestselling author of <i>The Blessed Life.</i></b><br><br>Who doesn't want to eliminate financial stress?

But how is Hinduism defined, and what basis does the religion have? In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em>, Kim Knott provides clear insight into the beliefs and authority of Hindus and Hinduism, and considers the ways in which it has been affected by colonialism and modernity.<br><br>Knott offers succinct explanations of Hinduism's central preoccupations, including the role of contemporary gurus and teachers in the quest for spiritual fulfillment; and the function of regular performances of the Mahabharata and Ramayana--scriptures which present the divine in personal form (<em>avatara</em>) and provide models of behavior for everyone, from kings and warriors to servants and children, and which focus on the <em>dharma</em>, the appropriate duties and moral responsibilities of the different <em>varna</em> or classes. The author also considers the challenges posed to Hinduism at the end of the twentieth century as it spreads far beyond India, and as concerns are raised about issues such as dowry, death, caste prejudice, and the place of women in Hindu society.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style,<strong> Very Short Introductions </strong>offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics.

Her research has focused specifically on mechanisms of change, including negative affect, thought suppression, and craving. She is particularly interested in the application of mindfulness-based work to dual-diagnosis populations. Dr. Bowen has co-facilitated mindfulness-based relapse prevention groups in numerous settings, including private and county treatment agencies and the VA Medical Center in Seattle. She also presents, consults, and teaches on the use of mindfulness-based treatment for substance use disorders.&nbsp;Neha Chawla, PhD, is a postdoctoral fellow in the Addictive Behaviors Research Center at the University of Washington. Her research focuses on the development and evaluation of mindfulness-based treatments for substance use disorders, issues related to therapist training and dissemination, and the assessment of therapist competence. Dr. Chawla has facilitated numerous mindfulness-based relapse prevention groups in private and community treatment settings in Seattle and on the East Coast, and has co-led several therapist training workshops.<p>G. Alan Marlatt, PhD, until his death in 2011, was Director of the Addictive Behaviors Research Center and Professor of Psychology at the University of Washington. For over 30 years, Dr. Marlatt conducted pioneering work on understanding and preventing relapse in substance abuse treatment and was a leading proponent of the harm reduction approach to treating addictive behaviors.

Rosengren, PhD, President, Prevention Research Institute, Lexington, Kentucky<br> &nbsp;<br> "Here is a book that contains both an evidence-based program and an invitation to explore a wholly new way of dealing with addictive feelings and behaviors. It is based on many years of painstaking research on the factors that help or hinder the long journey to recovery after addiction. It explains in helpful detail the demands and huge potential of the mindfulness approach for clinicians and clients. This book will be an inspiration to all who read it, and transformative for those who practice it."--Mark Williams, DPhil, Wellcome Principal Research Fellow, Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, United Kingdom<br><br> "I&#x2019;m very impressed by the systematic approach to recovery that Bowen et al. offer. This book gives clear guidance on how to blend mindfulness, a sometimes vague topic, with addiction treatment, a notoriously slippery enterprise.

I&#x2019;ll be using this book in my own teaching."--Kevin Griffin, author of <i>One Breath at a Time</i></p><p>"Mindfulness is the single most powerful tool available for those seeking freedom from addiction. Drawing on their notable wealth of research and clinical experience, Bowen et al. have created a groundbreaking relapse prevention program. For any therapist drawn to the practice of mindfulness, this guide provides a clear, accessible, and sensitive way to engage clients in a process of deep transformation and healing."--Tara Brach, PhD, author of <i>Radical Acceptance</i></p><br>"The detailed session guides in this manual are very helpful. Each begins with a box containing a list of needed materials, the theme for the session, goals, and a detailed outline. In addition, each session has practice guidelines for the in-session exercises, sample dialogue between the facilitator and participants, and tracking forms for the home practice exercises. There is also information on topics that are clearly drawn from experience practicing mindfulness and delivering the program, including how to discuss common reactions to the mindfulness exercises, including sleepiness, agitation, thought wandering, and emotions. Facilitators who have the recommended experience with their own mindfulness practice should be able to pick this book up and start conducting the sessions....Well worth the read for psychologists interested in mindfulness in general or its application to addiction treatment specifically. It provides an excellent example of a manual-guided approach to mindfulness training that can be used in clinical practice and evaluated in research studies.", <i>PsycCRITIQUES</i> Published On: 2010-11-11</p><h2>The Essential Oils Diet: Lose Weight and Transform Your Health with the Power of Essential Oils and Bioactive Foods</h2><p><b>The first diet program that harnesses essential oils and bioactive foods for weight loss and disease prevention, from the nation&#x2019;s trusted authority in essential oils and natural remedies.</b><br><br> The runaway success of <i>The Healing Power of Essential Oils</i> showed that there is a growing interest in using essential oils to heal the body.

Do not conform to the pattern of this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God&#x2019;s will is&#x2014;His good, pleasing and perfect will.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x2014;Romans 12:1&#x2013;2<br><br>Are you impatient to get to the recipes and guidelines for the Essential Oils Diet? Are you eager to start using essential oils to support your weight loss? Are you hoping that this combination of food and essential oils may be the magic bullet that finally allows you to take control of your eating habits?<br><br>Whoa! Let&#x2019;s slow down for a moment. Jumping in too quickly without understanding the strategy behind our program could all too soon turn your enthusiasm to disappointment. Our recipes are delicious, easy to prepare, and nutritious, and the use of essential oils to assist in weight loss is backed by solid research. We even have an exercise program that you can quickly incorporate into your daily routine. Our approach is flexible enough to fit any lifestyle and food preferences. And we are excited to share our wonderful essential oil blends to moderate hunger, salves to help massage away belly fat, and the exercises Sabrina has designed to tone your body.<br><br>All well and good, but without a firm mind-set transformed to focus on success, a commitment to make these new habits a way of life, and a belief in the outcome of your actions, you may wind up a few months from now discouraged and searching for yet another magic bullet to banish your extra pounds.<br><br>That is the last thing we want you to experience. Instead, we want to encourage you to embark on a transformative journey.<br><br>So, slow down and let us explain the underlying principles that ground the Essential Oils Diet. Trust us, doing so will significantly increase your likelihood of succeeding on the program. In fact, the changes we are talking about are nothing less than transformational. Both of us have experienced such dramatic and lasting changes in our own lives, which we shared in the introduction. Our hope and our belief is that this book will provide the blessings of such an experience to all who read it and commit to our program.<br><br>If you&#x2019;re a page skimmer or simply skipped the preface and/or introduction, we urge you to go back and pay special attention to that essential content. You will get so much more out of this book&#x2014;and we&#x2019;re not just talking about taking control of your weight, we&#x2019;re talking about changing your life&#x2014;if you understand where we are coming from and follow the steps we have laid out.<br><br>Two Sides of the Same Coin<br><br>At its core, this is a healthy living book. Live a healthy life and you&#x2019;re going to lose weight just by virtue of being healthy. And as part of this commitment to health, you&#x2019;ll learn ways to accelerate weight loss. For example, we&#x2019;ll explain how matcha green tea contains fat-burning compounds called catechins. Another example: You&#x2019;ll learn how simply inhaling lime essential oil can help burn body fat.<br><br>We understand that initially the goal of transformation to good health is rather abstract, while seeing excess pounds melt away is a more immediate and exciting transformation. Fortunately, the Essential Oils Diet achieves both goals.<br><br>Need to Gain Weight?<br><br>When you eat bioactive-rich food and incorporate essential oils into your life, your body achieves its ideal weight. That means that the Essential Oils Diet is equally effective if chronic illness, an overactive thyroid, injury, or other issues have made it difficult to gain weight. If so, you should skip the Fast Track and go right to the Essential Lifestyle. The same applies if you&#x2019;re happy with your current weight but want to improve your overall health.<br><br>The Truth About Diets<br><br>We hate to break it to you, but weight-loss diets almost always fail, but not because you cannot stick with a certain program, have a genetic tendency to be overweight, have a burdened metabolism, or suffer from a damaged microbiome. We know that this statement flies in the face of what you have read elsewhere. Some of these supposed causes are myths, others apply to very few people, and still others are a result, not a cause, of weight gain.<br><br>As we alerted you in the preface, this is not a conventional diet book. By that we mean food is not at the core of the problem&#x2014;nor is it the solution. If you follow the Essential Oils Diet, we can all but promise that you will find your body&#x2019;s ideal weight. Most people will lose weight. If you need to lose a lot of weight, you will do so relatively quickly. We know that obesity is directly linked to the development of cancer, diabetes, and autoimmune disorders, so once you begin your transformation, you won&#x2019;t be as susceptible to these diseases. Bonus!<br><br>The Essential Oils Diet is a two-stage program. As the name implies, the Essential Fast Track helps you banish excess pounds quickly&#x2014;think readying for your daughter&#x2019;s wedding, a Caribbean vacation, or a college reunion&#x2014;but more importantly, it is the gateway to the Essential Lifestyle. The startup lasts for thirty days, or longer if you have more than ten pounds to banish.<br><br>Now let&#x2019;s take a good, hard look at why most if not all weight-loss diets fail.<br><br>Useless and Misleading Information<br><br>The Nutrition Facts panel on food labels is of no real help in telling you whether a food item is worth eating. Do you really know what constitutes a gram of sugar, fiber, or carbohydrate, other than the fact that it is a tiny amount? And does looking at the numbers of grams and percentages of calories and fats really tell you whether something benefits your health or will help you control your weight? Of course not.<br><br>The only part of packaged food labels that is remotely helpful is the ingredients list, although that usually just alerts you to the fact that there are numerous ingredients you&#x2019;ve neither heard of nor can pronounce because you don&#x2019;t have a degree in toxicology!<br><br>In 1980, the US Department of Health and Human Services and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) jointly released Nutrition and Your Health: Dietary Guidelines for Americans in an effort to educate the public about how to eat. The food pyramid was designed to be a visual representation of the dietary guidelines, but it was equally incomprehensible, which is undoubtedly why it was laid to rest a few years ago and replaced with a graphic called MyPlate. This is equally unhelpful in determining what to eat and how much of it. But here&#x2019;s the kicker: Guess when the rise in overweight and obesity began? You guessed it&#x2014;1980. And it has continued to climb stratospherically ever since.1<br><br>The food pyramid was incorrect, and nutrition labels remain useless because they focus only on &#x201c;essential&#x201d; nutrients, meaning such things as protein, carbs, vitamins, and minerals your body cannot make on its own but are essential for life. Neither the food pyramid nor nutrition labels focus on so-called nonessential nutrients such as bioactive compounds, which provide an abundant life of vibrant health. Yes, essential nutrients are necessary to keep you alive. You could stay alive on a feeding tube, but it wouldn&#x2019;t mean you&#x2019;re truly alive. More on this distinction in chapter 2.<br><br>A food label provides only a bare minimum of information. A minimalist attitude connotes just squeaking by. What&#x2019;s the least I can do? Diets fail because their approach encourages the human tendency to do the bare minimum, not to go above and beyond. Diets don&#x2019;t offer an abundant mind-set. It&#x2019;s like &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the lowest possible grade I could get on this test to pass the class?&#x201d; The fact that we&#x2019;re still talking only about vitamins and minerals and protein and carbs just shows us that, as a society, our understanding of nutrition is archaic.<br><br>Most egregious of all, the recommended daily value (RDV) percentages that you see on food labels are based on a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet. First off, most people do not even realize this. Secondly, even if they did, they wouldn&#x2019;t know how to make this knowledge even the slightest bit useful!<br><br>Case in point: Do you know how many calories you should be eating each day? How about your spouse? Your youngest child? Your teenager? Do you know how much they should be consuming? If you did, would this change the foods you served your family?<br><br>Truth is, you have no idea and neither do we, because no one knows! It&#x2019;s literally impossible to calculate your caloric needs on a daily basis. And making your food choices on RDVs should not&#x2014;we repeat should not&#x2014;determine your food choices.<br><br>To watch a video shopping tour in which we show you how we read food labels and choose the best foods in supermarkets, go to EssentialOilsDiet.com.<br><br>The number of calories required to sustain a healthy, abundant life depends on your age, weight, height, metabolic type, activity level, and a slew of other factors that would make your head spin if we listed them all. Suffice it to say that your caloric needs on any given day will definitely not be the same on any other given day. Not to mention that the same applies to each member of your family!<br><br>To base your daily intake of vitamins, minerals, and macronutrients (carbs, proteins, and fats) on the percentages listed on your food labels is utterly illogical. This count-by-numbers approach has dominated the field of nutrition for decades, replacing common sense.<br><br>Diets Are Unsustainable<br><br>Another reason so many diets don&#x2019;t work in the long term is that they are unrealistically restrictive. Their focus is on short-term abstinence for quick weight loss, not long-term transformation.<br><br>If you have followed a low-carb diet that eliminated or drastically cut down on fruit, grains, and other carbohydrate-rich foods, you probably saw some pounds fall away. Low-fat diets tell you to eliminate or drastically reduce fat intake. Ketogenic diets advise just the opposite: eat lots of fat. Paleo diets are typically fat and protein heavy. This conflicting information is enough to give you a severe case of diet whiplash!<br><br>Cutting out almost all fat or carbohydrates is just plain unrealistic for the vast majority of people. (Nor is it healthy or natural to overeat protein and/or fat.) When you follow a rigid program, you may be missing out on important micronutrients essential to good health. And after a while, even if you can stick with such a restrictive program, your body adapts to it and weight loss ceases.<br><br>The bottom line is, if a way of eating isn&#x2019;t satisfying and enjoyable, you&#x2019;re more than likely going to revert to what you&#x2019;ve enjoyed in the past. (And if you are the main cook in the family, preparing one meal for yourself and another for the rest of the gang gets old fast.) That&#x2019;s why most &#x201c;diets&#x201d; work for a few weeks or a few months, until a person is impelled to &#x201c;cheat,&#x201d; gets discouraged, and goes back to her old way of eating, with predictable results.<br><br>We cannot stress enough how flexible our program is. If you have certain food sensitivities or allergies, simply avoid those foods. If you&#x2019;re a vegan or a vegetarian, no problem&#x2014;in fact, this is a plant-centric program. If you hate such and such a food, no one is saying you have to eat it. When it comes to essential oils, each person&#x2019;s response to a specific oil is different, and we&#x2019;ll help you find the ones that work best for you.<br><br>Unless a diet becomes a lifestyle, as you&#x2019;ll learn that the Essential Oils Diet does, it is almost invariably doomed to failure.<br><br>Beware of the Yo-Yo Effect<br><br>All too often people regain all the lost weight or even add on a few extra pounds when they return to their &#x201c;normal&#x201d; diet. This is referred to as the &#x201c;yo-yo effect,&#x201d; and it happens a lot with low-carb, high-fat diets.<br><br>Of all the various food plans out there, the yo-yo effect is most profound in the ketogenic diet&#x2014;an approach similar to the Atkins diet in that it heavily restricts the consumption of fruits, grains, and legumes, with the result that 5 percent of your energy intake comes from carbs, 15 to 25 percent from protein, and about 75 percent from fat. It&#x2019;s important to realize that a vast majority of research trials evaluating keto&#x2019;s effect on humans have lasted only a few weeks or a couple of months at most. There is no way to determine the long-term weight-loss benefits from current studies. Animal studies, however, are more robust and suggest that the weight loss achieved is relatively short-lived.<br><br>Longer-term animal studies reveal that weight loss ceases after eighteen to twenty-two weeks on the ketogenic diet, at which point weight starts to return to normal and then gradually increases2, 3. This is not to say that humans will gain weight after following a keto approach for five or six months; we&#x2019;re simply pointing out that the literature does not support long-term benefits for people following ketogenic and other low-carb diets, and it also suggests that the weight-loss benefits will be relatively short-lived.<br><br>The Absence of Abundance<br><br>The Healing Power of Essential Oils was all about helping you use essential oils to enjoy an abundant life. Another reason why diets fail and why transformation works is because the restriction inherent in diets completely ignores the concept of abundance. We can deny ourselves satisfying tasty food for only so long. There are numerous ways the Essential Oils Diet enables you to have your cake and eat it, too, including a recipe for the healthy, naturally sweetened, abundant-life-giving Our Carrot Wedding Cake (page 271).<br><br>Denial is unsustainable. No one in her right mind wants to remain in boot camp the rest of her life. We know that the Essential Fast Track isn&#x2019;t sustainable for a long period of time, just as a low-fat or low-carb diet isn&#x2019;t. No strict program is satisfying long-term. Instead, the Essential Fast Track morphs into a natural and abundant way of eating you can enjoy for the rest of your life.<br><br>Time Is of the Essence<br><br>All too many diets boast that you can lose ten, twenty, thirty, or some impressive number of pounds in as many days. This is completely unrealistic and sets you up for failure. Initial weight loss almost always slows over time. Conceivably, someone who is extremely overweight and restricts her intake dramatically for a month could lose thirty pounds, but that is hardly the norm. That&#x2019;s why most thirty-day diets fail. It is simply not enough time to take off weight and maintain that loss when the person returns to her old way of eating. You need to continue beyond thirty days, which is why we have you transition into the Essential Lifestyle, which is designed to be a permanent way of eating, after the Essential Fast Track.</p><h2>Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Designs for Research</h2><p>A survey drawn from social-science research which deals with correlational, ex post facto, true experimental, and quasi-experimental designs and makes methodological recommendations.

Yet it is one of many myths that must be discarded if we are to understand just how a tiny messianic movement on the edge of the Roman Empire became the dominant faith of Western civilization. In a fast-paced, highly readable book that addresses beliefs as well as historical facts, Rodney Stark brings a sociologist's perspective to bear on the puzzle behind the success of early Christianity. He comes equipped not only with the logic and methods of social science but also with insights gathered firsthand into why people convert and how new religious groups recruit members. He digs deep into the historical evidence on many issues--such as the social background of converts, the mission to the Jews, the status of women in the church, the role of martyrdom--to provide a vivid and unconventional account of early Christianity.</p><br><p> The author plots the most plausible curve of Christian growth from the year 40 to 300. By the time of Constantine, Christianity had become a considerable force, with growth patterns very similar to those of modern-day successful religious movements. An unusual number of Christian converts, for example, came from the educated, cosmopolitan classes. Because it offered a new perspective on familiar concepts and was not linked to ethnicity, Christianity had a large following among persons seeking to assimilate into the dominant culture, mainly Hellenized Jews. The oversupply of women in Christian communities--due partly to the respect and protection they received--led to intermarriages with pagans, hence more conversions, and to a high fertility rate. Stark points out, too, the role played by selflessness and faith. Amidst the epidemics, fires, and other disasters that beleaguered Greco-Roman cities, Christian communities were a stronghold of mutual aid, which resulted in a survival rate far greater than that of the pagans. In the meantime, voluntary martyrdom, especially a generation after the death of Christ, reinforced the commitment of the Christian rank and file. What Stark ultimately offers is a multifaceted portrait of early Christianity, one that appeals to practical reasoning, historical curiosity, and personal reflection.</p></p><p><p>"This brilliant and highly provocative book will revolutionize the way people think about both biblical studies and church history."<b>--Irving Hexham</b></p><p>"A provocative, insightful, challenging account. . .

Sturdy, portable, and easy-to-use, it features the most complete information available on every bird species known to North America. This revised edition features 250 completely updated range maps, new plumage and species classification information, specially commissioned full-color illustrations, and a superb new index that allows birders in the field to quickly identify a species.</p> <p>The <i>National Geographic Field Guide to the Birds of North America, Fourth Edition</i> will continue to be a bestseller among the fastest-growing sector in the U.S. travel market&#x2014;the nearly 25 million people who travel each year specifically to observe wild birds.</p></p><p>The fourth edition of this popular field guide adds some valuable features, including updated maps and taxonomic classifications. A new "quick-find" index of common groups refers experienced birders to the right page, fast, but won't be much use to novices. Nevertheless, the book's organization is clear, the illustrations are realistic and more colorful than ever, and the range maps are easy to understand. The guide covers all North American bird species, including seabirds. In his introduction to the new edition, Cornell ornithologist John W. Fitzpatrick motivates birders of all levels, extolling the virtues of this field guide in helping ordinary citizens add to the store of scientific knowledge. And he's right: marking the little checkboxes in the index as you spot each species is satisfying science that can be done by anyone, including kids. Another delightful feature is the phonetic spellings of bird calls, such as the "kakakowlp-kowlp" of the Yellow-billed Cuckoo or the "few-few-fawee" of the Western bluebird. This remains one of the best portable bird guides in publication, tough enough to take in the field, but detailed enough for hours of armchair browsing. 800 illustrations, 630 maps. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Idiot (Modern Library Classics)</h2><p>Returning to Russia from a sanitarium in Switzerland, the Christ-like epileptic Prince Myshkin finds himself enmeshed in a tangle of love, torn between two women&#x2014;the notorious kept woman Nastasya and the pure Aglaia&#x2014;both involved, in turn, with the corrupt, money-hungry Ganya.

He was born about 485 B.C. on the island of Salamis and may have begun a career as a painter before writing in the drama competitions in 455 B.C. During his lifetime his plays were often produced, but he won the Athenian drama prize only four times. He died in 406 B.C.<br><br>Euripides was a prolific writer, the author of some eighty-eight or more plays, of which nineteen have survived under his name. He was criticized by the conservatives of his time for introducing shabby heroes and immoral women into his plays, a practice that they considered degrading to the noble form of tragedy. However, audiences to whom his predecessors were cold and remote found Euripides direct and appealing. <br><br>Euripides became immensely popular after he died and his influence altered drama forever. Considered by George Bernard Shaw to be the greatest of the Greek dramatists, Euripides is now regarded by many as the originator of the dramatic sensibility that developed into what we call "modern" European drama.ALCESTIS<br><br>CHARACTERS<br>Apollo<br>Death<br>Chorus, elders of Pherae<br>Handmaid<br>Alcestis, wife of Admetus<br>Admetus, King of Pherae<br>Eumelus, son of Admetus and Alcestis<br>Heracles<br>Pheres, father of Admetus<br>Butler<br>Guards, attendants, mourners<br>The scene represents the palace of Admetus at Pherae.<br>Alcestis was acted in 438 b.c.<br><br>[Enter Apollo, gorgeously dressed, with bow and quiver.]<br><br>APOLLO. House of Admetus, in which I condescended to put up with a slave's table, I a god! Zeus was the cause: he killed my son Asclepius by hurling the lightning into his breast, and I in my anger slew the Cyclopes who fashion Zeus' fire; for this has the father constrained me to do bond service to a mortal man.<br><br>I came to this land and tended cattle for my host, and I preserved his house to this day. In the son of Pheres I found a pious man, as I myself am pious, and I rescued him from death by tricking the Fates. These deities agreed that Admetus could escape Hades for the present by offering in exchange another body to the spirits below. He canvassed and solicited all his friends, his aged father and the mother who bore him, but he found no one except his wife willing for his sake to die and to forgo the light of day.<br><br>His wife is now moving about the house supported in his arms and is gasping her last, for upon this day it is fated for her to die and quit this life. I am leaving the friendly shelter of these halls lest the pollution of death come upon me within doors. Already I perceive Death hard by, the priest of the dead who is ready to lead her down to the house of Hades. Punctually does he arrive; he has been watching for this day upon which she must die.<br><br>[Enter Death, in a fearful and gloomy dress, with a bare sword.]<br><br>DEATH. Ha! Ha! What are you up to outside the palace, why are you prowling about here, Phoebus? Are you at your tricks again? Appropriating the dues of the powers below and ending our perquisites? Was it not enough for you to prevent the death of Admetus by beguiling the Fates with a sly trick? Now you have armed your hand with a bow to keep guard also over this woman, this daughter of Pelias, who saved her husband by undertaking to die for him herself.<br>APOLLO. Never fear. Justice and fair arguments are on my side.<br>DEATH. What need of a bow if justice is on your side?<br>APOLLO. It is my habit to wear it always.<br>DEATH. Yes, and to give illegal aid to this house.<br>APOLLO. I am weighed down by the predicament of a man that is my friend.<br>DEATH. Will you deprive me of this second body too?<br>APOLLO. I did not take that other from you by force.<br>DEATH. Why then is he upon the earth, and not below ground?<br>APOLLO. Because he gave his wife as ransom, for whom you are now come.<br>DEATH. Yes, and I shall drag her below, underneath the earth.<br>APOLLO. Take her and go; I doubt if I can persuade you----<br>DEATH. To kill whom I must? Why, that is my office.<br>APOLLO. Not so, but to cast death upon those that are ripe for it.<br>DEATH. I understand your logic--and your zeal!<br>APOLLO. Is there any way, then, that Alcestis may reach old age?<br>DEATH. There is not. Consider that I too take pleasure in my prerogatives.<br>APOLLO. You would not be getting more than a single life.<br>DEATH. When the young die I gain the greater prize.<br>APOLLO. But if she die old she will be buried magnificently.<br>DEATH. Phoebus! You lay down your law in favor of the rich.<br>APOLLO. How do you mean? You a sophist too? Who would have thought it?<br>DEATH. Those who could, would buy the privilege of dying old.<br>APOLLO. Then you will not grant me this favor?<br>DEATH. No. You know my ways.<br>APOLLO. Yes, hateful to men and loathed by the gods.<br>DEATH. You cannot have everything which is not your due.<br>APOLLO. Yet will you forbear, exceedingly cruel though you are. A man will come to the house of Pheres, sent by Eurystheus to fetch a team of horses from the wintry regions of Thrace. He will be entertained in the house of Admetus, and will wrest this woman from you by force. Nor will you have any thanks from me; you will do this thing notwithstanding, and you will have my hate.<br><br>[Exit Apollo.]<br><br>DEATH. Talk on; it will do you no good. This woman shall descend to the house of Hades. I am advancing upon her to initiate my rites with the sword. Devoted to the nether gods is the head whose hair this weapon consecrates.<br><br>[Exit Death into the palace. Enter Chorus.]<br><br>CHORUS [the mark at the beginning of a line indicates a change of speaker].--What means this quiet before the halls?<br>--Why is the house of Admetus silent?<br>--No friend is near, none who might tell us whether we must mourn our queen as dead, or whether Pelias' child yet lives and looks upon this light, Alcestis, who has proven to us and to everyone that she is the noblest of wives.<br>--Does anyone hear a moaning, or a beating of hands in the house, or a wailing as if all were over?<br>--And yet none of the domestics stands before the house. Show thyself, O Healer, amid the billows of disaster!<br>--I'm sure they would not be silent if she were dead.<br>--She is already a corpse.<br>--At any rate, she is not yet gone forth from the house.<br>--How do you know? I am not sure. What gives you hope?<br>--How would Admetus have denied a cortege to his noble wife?<br>--I do not see before the doors the pitcher of fountain water which is customary at the doors of the departed.<br>--Nor is there shorn hair in the vestibule such as falls in sorrow for the dead, nor the noise of the hands of young women.<br>--Yet this is the fated day--<br>--What is this you say?<br>--On which she is doomed to go below the earth.<br>--You have touched my soul, you have touched my heart.<br>--When the noble are afflicted, loyalty tried and true must grieve.<br>--No spot on earth is there, neither in Lycia nor in the waterless seats of Ammon, where a pilgrim's voyage might redeem this hapless life. Sheer fate is nigh, and I know not to whom I should go of them that sacrifice sheep at the altars of the gods.<br>--If only Phoebus' son (Asclepius) were alive and looked upon this light, then could she leave the shrouded abode and the gates of Hades and come to us; for he used to quicken even the dead before the Zeus-hurled bolt of lightning fire destroyed him. But now what hope of her life can I yet hold?<br>--All the rites have been accomplished by the king, upon the altars of all the gods do blood-dripping sacrifices abound. There is no remedy for these evils.<br><br>[Enter Handmaid, weeping.]<br><br>LEADER. But here comes one of the attendants, all in tears. What fortune shall I hear? [To Handmaid] To grieve if anything befalls our masters is pardonable. But we should like to know whether the lady is still in life or whether she has perished.<br>HANDMAID. You may call her both living and dead.<br>LEADER. How can the same person be dead and still see the light?<br>HANDMAID. She is already drooping and breathing her last.<br>LEADER. Ah, unfortunate! Such a man, to lose such a wife!<br>HANDMAID. My master does not realize this; he has not yet felt it.<br>LEADER. Is there no longer hope of saving her life?<br>HANDMAID. No, for this is the day, and destiny is strong.<br>LEADER. Is everything requisite being done for her?<br>HANDMAID. The adornments with which her husband will bury her are ready.<br>LEADER. Let her know that she dies glorious, the best woman under the sun by far.<br>HANDMAID. Certainly the best. Who would gainsay it? What must the woman be who would surpass her? How could any woman demonstrate greater regard for her husband than by consenting to die for him? But this all the city knows. You will marvel when you hear what she did within the house. When she realized that the destined day had come she washed her white body with river water, and chose garments and ornaments from her cedar chests and adorned herself becomingly, and then she stood before the hearth and prayed: "Lady, I am going below earth, and for the last time I kneel before you. I beseech you, care for my orphan children: join to my son a loving wife, to my daughter a noble husband. Let not my children perish untimely like their mother, but with good fortune let them round out a happy life in their own country."<br>All the altars in the house of Admetus did she approach, and she crowned them and offered prayer, plucking sprigs of myrtle from the branches; she uttered no cry or groan, and the approaching evil did not alter the comely appearance of her person. Then she flew into her chamber and up to her bed. There she wept and spoke as follows: "O couch where I loosed my maiden zone by the hand of him for whom I die, farewell. I do not hate you. You have destroyed me alone. It is because I dread to betray you and my husband that I die. Some other woman will possess you, no more chaste, perhaps more fortunate."<br>She fell upon it and kissed it, and all the bedding was moistened with the tears that suffused her eyes. And when she has had her fill of weeping she flings herself forth from the bed and departs downcast. Often she makes to quit the chamber, and often she turns back, and again throws herself upon the bed.<br>Her children were hanging from their mother's dress and weeping, and she took them into her arms and fondled first one and then the other, as being on the point of death. All the servants throughout the house wept in pity for their mistress. But she extended her right hand to each one, and there was none so humble but that she addressed him and heard his reply.<br>Such are Admetus' evils within the house. If he had died he would have perished, but now that he has escaped he has such anguish as he will never forget.<br>LEADER. Admetus is surely groaning at this trouble, at having to lose his noble wife?<br>HANDMAID. Yes, he holds his dear wife in his arms and weeps, and beseeches her not to forsake him, asking what is impossible; for she is wasting away and sinking in her malady. Feeble as she is, a sad burden in his hand, still with the little breath that she has she desires to look upon the rays of the sun, for she never again will see it. This is the last time.<br>But I shall go and announce your presence. Not everyone is so well disposed to his lords as to stand by them in their troubles. But you have been friendly to my master from of old.<br><br>[Exit Handmaid.]<br><br>CHORUS. O Zeus can there be any deliverance at all from these evils, any solution for the fortune which hovers over our lords?<br>--Ah me! Ah me! Is there any? Or shall I shear my hair and clothe me now in a habit of black raiment?<br>--Plain it is, my friends, too plain. Yet let us pray to the gods, for very great is their power.<br>--O Lord Healer, contrive some device for Admetus' evils!<br>--Grant it, yea grant it! Aforetime did you contrive it: be now too a deliverer from death; hold back bloody Hades!<br>--Alas! How you have suffered, O son of Pheres, bereft of your wife!<br>--Alack! This is enough to provoke self slaughter, more than enough to put one's neck in a hanging noose.<br>--Not a dear wife, nay, but the dearest wife will you see dead this day.<br>--Look, look! She comes forth from the house, and her husband with her.<br>--Cry out, O land of Pheres, and groan, for the noblest of women; disease is wasting her down to Hades below earth.<br>LEADER. Never shall I declare that marriage brings more happiness than sorrow. My evidence is past experience and the observation of the present misfortunes of the king, who is bereft of his excellent wife and will henceforward live a life unlivable.<br><br>[The palace doors open; enter Alcestis supported in the arms of Admetus, Eumelus and his sister clinging to their mother, and servants who proceed to arrange a couch.]<br><br>ALCESTIS. Sun and light of day, heavenly eddies of fleeting clouds----<br>ADMETUS. Look upon you and me, two unhappy creatures who have done nothing to the gods for which you should die.<br>ALCESTIS. Earth and that high-roofed palace in my native Iolcus, with its bridal bed!<br>ADMETUS. Rouse yourself, poor woman, do not desert me. Pray to the gods who are powerful to pity.<br>ALCESTIS. I see the two-oared boat, I see it upon the lake. The ferryman of the dead has his hand upon the pole, Charon is already calling me: "Why do you linger? Hasten! You are delaying us." So is he hurrying me, brusquely.<br>ADMETUS. Alas! This is a bitter voyage for me that you speak of. Ah, unhappy! What sufferings are ours!<br>ALCESTIS. He is dragging me, someone is dragging me--do you not see?--to the court of the dead. Under his dark brows he is gazing at me; he has wings. It is Hades. What will you do? Let go of me! What a road, what a luckless road I am entering upon!<br>ADMETUS. A pitiful road for your friends, but most of all for me and the children who share this sorrow.<br>ALCESTIS. Let me go, let me go now, lay me down: my feet have no strength. Hades is near. Dark night is creeping over my eyes. Children, my children, your mother is dying, dying. Farewell, my children, and look long upon the light.<br>ADMETUS. Ah me! It is a bitter word I hear, worse than any death to me. For heaven's sake, do not have the heart to abandon me, for the sake of these children whom you are making orphans, be brave! If you should die I would no longer exist: I am in your power, to live or not, for your love I adore.<br>ALCESTIS. Admetus, you see how it is with me. I want to declare my wishes before I die. I have honored you, and at the price of my life I have caused you to look upon this light. For your sake I die, though I could have survived and married any Thessalian I wished and lived in a house happy with kingship. But I was not willing to live separated from you, with my children orphaned, and I did not begrudge my youth, which I possessed and enjoyed. And yet he that begot you and she that bore you betrayed you, though they had come to a time of life fitting for death, fitting to save their son and die glorious. You were their only child, and they had no hope of getting other children if you were dead. Then I should have lived, and you too, the rest of our time, and you would not be groaning at the loss of your wife, and would not have to bring up your children motherless. But some god has caused these things to work out this way. So be it. But do you remember to render me gratitude for these things. I do not seek an equal return. That is impossible, for nothing is so precious as life. What I ask is only fair, as you yourself will admit.</p><h2>Holt Psychology: Principles in Practice: Student Edition 2007</h2><p>2007 Holt Psychology: Principles in Practice (H) by Spencer A.

He studied under Plato at Athens and taught there (367&#x2013;47); subsequently he spent three years at the court of a former pupil, Hermeias, in Asia Minor and at this time married Pythias, one of Hermeias&#x2019;s relations. After some time at Mitylene, in 343&#x2013;2 he was appointed by King Philip of Macedon to be tutor of his teen-aged son Alexander. After Philip&#x2019;s death in 336, Aristotle became head of his own school (of &#x201c;Peripatetics&#x201d;), the Lyceum at Athens. Because of anti-Macedonian feeling there after Alexander&#x2019;s death in 323, he withdrew to Chalcis in Euboea, where he died in 322.Nearly all the works Aristotle prepared for publication are lost; the priceless ones extant are lecture-materials, notes, and memoranda (some are spurious). They can be categorized as follows:I. Practical: <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>; <i>Great Ethics</i> (<i>Magna Moralia</i>); <i>Eudemian Ethics</i>; <i>Politics</i>; <i>Oeconomica</i> (on the good of the family); <i>Virtues and Vices</i>.<br>II.

At the end of his life, Kafka asked his lifelong friend and literary executor Max Brod to burn all his unpublished work. Brod overrode those wishes.<br><br><b>Mark Harman,</b> a native of Dublin who has written extensively about modern German and Irish literature, is a professor of German and English at Elizabeth College in Elizabeth, Pennsylvania. His translation of <i>The Castle </i>received the Modern Language Association's first Lois Roth Award in 1998.&#x201c;We are not too far wrong to see in Karl Rossmann the explorer who maps the internal territory for the later Kafka hero Joseph K. of <i>The Trial</i>. It is a natural segue, after all, from the youth who lives to placate to the adult with the inescapable sense of guilt. In fact, we could propose Kafka as an artist in a lifelong search of the most accommodating conceit for his vision. Karl is the earliest of his eponymous heroes, all of them essentially one tormented soul whose hallucinatory landscape keeps changing.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;E. L. Doctorow <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;More than eighty years after his death from tuberculosis at age forty, Kafka continues to defy simplifications, to force us to consider him anew.

These words still contain much truth today. Hesiod is a very important poet, and for this reason his two surviving poems, <em>Theogony </em>and <em>Works and Days, </em>deserve to be presented as accurately and attractively as possible. R. M. Frazer has done this: His new translations are faithful to the matter and spirit of the originals, and his commentary makes the poems understandable and enjoyable.</p> <p>Hesiod is the first Greek and, therefore, the first European we can know as a real person, for, unlike Homer, he tells us about himself in his poems. Hesiod seems to have been a successful farmer and a rather gloomy though not humorless man. One suspects from his concern for the bachelor's lot and some rather unflattering remarks about women that he was never married. A close study of both poems reveals the same personality -that of a deeply religious man concerned with the problems of justice and fate.</p> <p>The <em>Theogony </em>represents the first codification of the Greek pantheon. Hesiod, of course, did not invent the gods, but he gave the Greeks a clear picture of their forms, functions, and relationships. Thus, the poem deals with the high epic theme of the creation of the divine order of the world under the direction of Zeus. <em>Works and Days, </em>by contrast, considers justice and work in the context of Hesiod's own life. The difference in subject matter produces a difference in style: <em>Theogony </em>is strongly influenced by the epic conventions; <em>Works and Days </em>is more modern and freewheeling.</p> <p>To get a fuller picture of Hesiod and his poems, we must try to understand him in relation to his times. The eighth century, when Hesiod lived, was the time of the great Greek awakening after the period of relative darkness ushered in by the fall of the old Mycenaean kingdoms around 1125 B.C. Hesiod thus lived at the beginning of the Greek classical period, and his poems influenced not only that age but also Western culture in our day.</p></p><p><p><strong>R. M.

G. Wells writing and rewriting the fantastic tale that became his first book and an international sensation: <i>The Time Machine</i>. It was an era when a host of forces was converging to transmute the human understanding of time, some philosophical and some technological: the electric telegraph, the steam railroad, the discovery of buried civilizations, and the perfection of clocks. James Gleick tracks the evolution of time travel as an idea that becomes part of contemporary culture&#x2014;from Marcel Proust to <i>Doctor Who,</i> from Jorge Luis Borges to Woody Allen. He investigates the inevitable looping paradoxes and examines the porous boundary between pulp fiction and modern physics. Finally, he delves into a temporal shift that is unsettling our own moment: the instantaneous wired world, with its all-consuming present and vanishing future.<br><br><i>(With a color frontispiece and black-and-white illustrations throughout)&nbsp;</i></p><p><b>JAMES GLEICK</b> (around.com) is our leading chronicler of science and technology, the best-selling author of <i>Chaos: Making a New Science, Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman, </i>and <i>The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood</i>. His books have been translated into thirty languages.<b>ONE</b><br> <b><i>Machine</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> A man stands at the end of a drafty corridor, a.k.a. the nineteenth century, and in the flickering light of an oil lamp examines a machine made of nickel and ivory, with brass rails and quartz rods&#x2014;a squat, ugly contraption, somehow out of focus, not easy for the poor reader to visualize, despite the listing of parts and materials. Our hero fiddles with some screws, adds a drop of oil, and plants himself on the saddle. He grasps a lever with both hands. He is going on a journey. And by the way so are we. When he throws that lever, time breaks from its moorings.<br> &nbsp;<br> The man is nondescript, almost devoid of features&#x2014;&#x201c;grey eyes&#x201d; and a &#x201c;pale face&#x201d; and not much else. He lacks even a name. He is just the Time Traveller: &#x201c;for so it will be convenient to speak of him.&#x201d; <i>Time </i>and <i>travel: </i>no one had thought to join those words before now. And that machine? With its saddle and bars, it&#x2019;s a fantasticated bicy�cle. The whole thing is the invention of a young enthusiast named Wells, who goes by his initials, H. G., because he thinks that sounds more serious than Herbert. His family calls him Bertie. He is trying to be a writer. He is a thoroughly modern man, a believer in social�ism, free love, and bicycles. A proud member of the Cyclists&#x2019; Touring Club, he rides up and down the Thames valley on a forty-pounder with tubular frame and pneumatic tires, savoring the thrill of riding his machine: &#x201c;A memory of motion lingers in the muscles of your legs, and round and round they seem to go.&#x201d; At some point he sees a printed advertisement for a contraption called Hacker&#x2019;s Home Bicy�cle: a stationary stand with rubber wheels to let a person pedal for exercise without going anywhere. Anywhere through space, that is. The wheels go round and time goes by.<br> &nbsp;<br> The turn of the twentieth century loomed&#x2014;a calendar date with apocalyptic resonance. Albert Einstein was a boy at gymnasium in Munich. Not till 1908 would the Polish-German mathematician Hermann Minkowski announce his radical idea: &#x201c;Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an inde�pendent reality.&#x201d; H. G. Wells was there first, but unlike Minkowski, Wells was not trying to explain the universe. He was just trying to gin up a plausible-sounding plot device for a piece of fantastic story�telling.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nowadays we voyage through time so easily and so well, in our dreams and in our art. Time travel feels like an ancient tradition, rooted in old mythologies, old as gods and dragons. It isn&#x2019;t. Though the ancients imagined immortality and rebirth and lands of the dead time machines were beyond their ken. Time travel is a fantasy of the modern era. When Wells in his lamp-lit room imagined a time machine, he also invented a new mode of thought.<br> Why not before? And why now?<br> &nbsp;<br> ###<br> &nbsp;<br> The time traveller begins with a science lesson. Or is it just flummery? He gathers his friends around the drawing-room fire to explain that everything they know about time is wrong. They are stock characters from central casting: the Medical Man, the Psycholo�gist, the Editor, the Journalist, the Silent Man, the Very Young Man, and the Provincial Mayor, plus everyone&#x2019;s favorite straight man, &#x201c;an argumentative person with red hair&#x201d; named Filby.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You must follow me carefully,&#x201d; the Time Traveller instructs these stick figures. &#x201c;I shall have to controvert one or two ideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for instance, that they taught you at school is founded on a misconception.&#x201d; School geometry&#x2014;Euclid&#x2019;s geometry&#x2014;had three dimensions, the ones we can see: length, width, and height.<br> &nbsp;<br> Naturally they are dubious. The Time Traveller proceeds Socrati�cally. He batters them with logic. They put up feeble resistance.<br> &#x201c;You know of course that a mathematical line, a line of thickness <i>nil, </i>has no real existence. They taught you that? Neither has a mathematical plane. These things are mere abstractions.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That is all right,&#x201d; said the Psychologist.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a real existence.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There I object,&#x201d; said Filby. &#x201c;Of course a solid body may exist. All real things&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So most people think. But wait a moment. Can an <i>instanta�neous </i>cube exist?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t follow you,&#x201d; said Filby [the poor sap].<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Can a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real existence?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Filby became pensive. &#x201c;Clearly,&#x201d; the Time Traveller proceeded, &#x201c;any real body must have extension in <i>four </i>directions: it must have Length, Breadth, Thickness, and&#x2014;Duration.&#x201d;<br><br> ###<br> &nbsp;<br> Aha! The fourth dimension. A few clever Continental mathemati�cians were already talking as though Euclid&#x2019;s three dimensions were not the be-all and end-all. There was August M�bius, whose famous &#x201c;strip&#x201d; was a two-dimensional surface making a twist through the third dimension, and Felix Klein, whose loopy &#x201c;bottle&#x201d; implied a fourth; there were Gauss and Riemann and Lobachevsky, all think�ing, as it were, outside the box. For geometers the fourth dimension was an unknown direction at right angles to all our known directions. Can anyone visualize that? What direction is it? Even in the seven�teenth century, the English mathematician John Wallis, recognizing the algebraic possibility of higher dimensions, called them &#x201c;a Mon�ster in Nature, less possible than a Chimaera or Centaure.&#x201d; More and more, though, mathematics found use for concepts that lacked physi�cal meaning. They could play their parts in an abstract world without necessarily describing features of reality.<br> &nbsp;<br> Under the influence of these geometers, a schoolmaster named Edwin Abbott Abbott published his whimsical little novel <i>Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions </i>in 1884, in which two-dimensional creatures try to wrap their minds around the possibility of a third; and in 1888 Charles Howard Hinton, a son-in-law of the logician George Boole, invented the word <i>tesseract </i>for the four-dimensional analogue of the cube. The four-dimensional space this object encloses he called hypervolume. He populated it with hypercones, hyper pyramids, and hyperspheres. Hinton titled his book, not very modestly, <i>A New Era of Thought. </i>He suggested that this mysterious, not-quite-visible fourth dimension might provide an answer to the mystery of consciousness. &#x201c;We must be really four-dimensional creatures, or we could not think about four dimensions,&#x201d; he reasoned. To make mental models of the world and of ourselves, we must have special brain molecules: &#x201c;It may be that these brain molecules have the power of four-dimensional movement, and that they can go through four-dimensional movements and form four-dimensional structures.&#x201d; For a while in Victorian England the fourth dimension served as a catchall, a hideaway for the mysterious, the unseen, the spiritual&#x2014;anything that seemed to be lurking just out of sight. Heaven might be in the fourth dimension; after all, astronomers with their telescopes were not finding it overhead. The fourth dimension was a secret compartment for fantasists and occultists. &#x201c;We are on the eve of the Fourth Dimension; that is what it is!&#x201d; declared William T. Stead, a muckraking journalist who had been editor of the <i>Pall Mall Gazette, </i>in 1893. He explained that this could be expressed by mathematical formulas and could be imagined (&#x201c;if you have a vivid imagination&#x201d;) but could not actually be seen&#x2014;anyway not &#x201c;by mortal man.&#x201d; It was a place &#x201c;of which we catch glimpses now and then in those phenomena which are entirely unaccountable for by any law of three-dimensional space.&#x201d; For example, clairvoyance. Also telepathy. He submitted his report to the Psychical Research Society for their further investiga�tion. Nineteen years later he embarked on the <i>Titanic </i>and drowned at sea.<br> &nbsp;<br> By comparison Wells is so sober, so simple. No mysticism for him&#x2014;the fourth dimension is not a ghost world. It is not heaven, nor is it hell. It is time.<br> &nbsp;<br> What is time? Time is nothing but one more direction, orthogonal to the rest. As simple as that. It&#x2019;s just that no one has been able to see it till now&#x2014;till the Time Traveller. &#x201c;Through a natural infirmity of the flesh . . . we incline to overlook this fact,&#x201d; he coolly explains. <i>&#x201c;There is no difference between Time and any of the three dimensions of Space except that our consciousness moves along it.&#x201d;</i><br> &nbsp;<br> In surprisingly short order this notion would become part of the orthodoxy of theoretical physics.</p><h2>Lean Enterprise: How High Performance Organizations Innovate at Scale</h2><p><p>How well does your organization respond to changing market conditions, customer needs, and emerging technologies when building software-based products?

Such true charity permeates Dickens&#39; novels and ultimately drives the characters either to choose regeneration or risk disintegration. In Great Expectations, Pip--symbolic of the pilgrim convert--gains both improved fortunes and a growth in wisdom, but as he acquires the latter, he must relinquish the former--ending with a wealth of profound goodness, not of worldly goods. That the Dickensian message was a Christian one is unmistakable. Reminiscent of an Augustinian model, one of reflection, conversion, and moral improvement, Pip undergoes an internal change that manifests itself in his profound contrition for his earlier deeds and his equally profound resolution to make amends. As we travel with Pip, we find that Dickens leads us to an acceptance of worldly limitations and an anticipation of final salvation. The exciting new edition of Dickens&#39;s classic novel includes critical essays by some of today&#39;s leading Dickens scholars.</p><p>An absorbing mystery as well as a morality tale, the story of Pip, a poor village lad, and his expectations of wealth is Dickens at his most deliciously readable.

He studied under Plato at Athens and taught there (367&#x2013;47); subsequently he spent three years at the court of a former pupil, Hermeias, in Asia Minor and at this time married Pythias, one of Hermeias&#x2019;s relations. After some time at Mitylene, in 343&#x2013;2 he was appointed by King Philip of Macedon to be tutor of his teen-aged son Alexander. After Philip&#x2019;s death in 336, Aristotle became head of his own school (of &#x201c;Peripatetics&#x201d;), the Lyceum at Athens. Because of anti-Macedonian feeling there after Alexander&#x2019;s death in 323, he withdrew to Chalcis in Euboea, where he died in 322.Nearly all the works Aristotle prepared for publication are lost; the priceless ones extant are lecture-materials, notes, and memoranda (some are spurious). They can be categorized as follows:I. Practical: <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>; <i>Great Ethics</i> (<i>Magna Moralia</i>); <i>Eudemian Ethics</i>; <i>Politics</i>; <i>Oeconomica</i> (on the good of the family); <i>Virtues and Vices</i>.<br>II. Logical: <i>Categories</i>; <i>On Interpretation</i>; <i>Analytics</i> (<i>Prior</i> and <i>Posterior</i>); <i>On Sophistical Refutations</i>; <i>Topica</i>.<br>III. Physical: Twenty-six works (some suspect) including astronomy, generation and destruction, the senses, memory, sleep, dreams, life, facts about animals, etc.<br>IV. <i>Metaphysics</i>: on being as being.<br>V. On Art: <i>Art of Rhetoric</i> and <i>Poetics</i>.<br>VI. Other works including the <i>Athenian Constitution</i>; more works also of doubtful authorship.<br>VII.

When he was eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway. The couple had three children&#x2014;an older daughter Susanna and twins, Judith and Hamnet. Hamnet, Shakespeare&#x2019;s only son, died in childhood. The bulk of Shakespeare&#x2019;s working life was spent in the theater world of London, where he established himself professionally by the early 1590s. He enjoyed success not only as a playwright and poet, but also as an actor and shareholder in an acting company. Although some think that sometime between 1610 and 1613 Shakespeare retired from the theater and returned home to Stratford, where he died in 1616, others believe that he may have continued to work in London until close to his death.<br><br>Barbara A.

While most often discussed in terms of its images and its metrical and other formal structures, the language of the <i>Sonnets</i>, like that of Shakespeare's plays, also repays close attention to such basic linguistic elements as words, word order, and sentence structure. </p><p> </p><p> Shakespeare's Words </p><p> Because Shakespeare's sonnets were written four hundred years ago, they inevitably contain words that are unfamiliar today. Some are words that are no longer in general use -- words that the dictionaries label <i>archaic</i> or <i>obsolete</i>, or that have so fallen out of use that dictionaries no longer include them. One surprising feature of the <i>Sonnets</i> is how rarely such archaic words appear. Among the more than a thousand words that make up the first ten sonnets, for instance, only eleven are not to be found in current usage: <i>self-substantial</i> ("derived from one's own substance"), <i>niggarding</i> ("being miserly"), <i>unfair</i> ("deprive of beauty"), <i>leese</i> ("lose"), <i>happies</i> ("makes happy"), <i>steep-up</i> ("precipitous"), <i>highmost</i> ("highest"), <i>hap</i> ("happen"), <i>unthrift</i> ("spendthrift"), <i>unprovident</i> ("improvident"), and <i>ruinate</i> ("reduce to ruins"). Somewhat more common in the <i>Sonnets</i> are words that are still in use but that in Shakespeare's day had meanings that are no longer current. In the first three sonnets, for example, we find <i>only</i> used where we might say "peerless" or "preeminent," <i>gaudy</i> used to mean "brilliantly fine," <i>weed</i> where we would say "garment," <i>glass</i> where we would say "mirror," and <i>fond</i> where we would say "foolish." Words of this kind -- that is, words that are no longer used or that are used with unfamiliar meanings -- will be defined in our facing-page notes. </p><p> The most significant feature of Shakespeare's word choice in the <i>Sonnets</i> is his use of words in which multiple meanings function simultaneously. In line 5 of the first sonnet, for example, the word <i>contracted</i> means "bound by contract, bethrothed," but it also carries the sense of "limited, shrunken." Its double meaning enables the phrase "contracted to thine own bright eyes" to say succinctly to the young man not only that he has betrothed himself to his own good looks but that he has also thereby become a more limited person. In a later line in the same sonnet ("Within thine own bud buriest thy content" [s. 1.11]), the fact that <i>thy content</i> means both (1) "that which is contained within you, specifically, your seed, that with which you should produce a child," and (2) "your happiness" enables the line to say, in a highly compressed fashion, that by refusing to propagate, refusing to have a child, the young man is destroying his own future well-being. </p><p> It is in large part through choosing words that carry more than one pertinent meaning that Shakespeare packs into each sonnet almost incalculable richness of thought and imagery. In the opening line of the first sonnet ("From fairest creatures we desire increase"), each of the words <i>fairest, creatures</i>, and <i>increase</i> carries multiple relevant senses; when these combine with each other, the range of significations in this single line is enormous. In Shakespeare's day, the word <i>fair</i> primarily meant "beautiful," but it had recently also picked up the meaning of "blond" and "fair-skinned." In this opening line of Sonnet 1, the meaning "blond" is probably not operative (though it becomes extremely pertinent when the word <i>fair</i> is used in later sonnets), but the aristocratic (or upper-class) implications of "fair-skinned" are very much to the point (or so argues Margreta de Grazia; see Further Reading), since upper-class gentlemen and ladies need not work out of doors and expose their skins to wind and sun. (The negative class implications of outdoor labor carried in the sonnets by "dark" or "tanned" are carried today in the label "redneck.") The second word, <i>creatures</i>, had several meanings, referring, for example, to everything created by God, including the plant kingdom, while in some contexts referring specifically to human beings. When combined with the third word, <i>increase</i> (which meant, among its pertinent definitions, "procreation," "breeding," "offspring," "a child," "crops," and "fruit"), the word <i>creatures</i> takes the reader's mind to Genesis 1.28 and God's instructions to humankind to multiply and be fruitful, while the plant-life connotation of all three of the words provides a context for later words in the sonnet, such as <i>rose, famine, abundance, spring</i>, and <i>bud</i>. The words Shakespeare places in this first line ("From <i>fairest</i> <i>creatures</i> we desire <i>increase</i>") -- with their undoubted link to concerns about upper-class propagation and inheritance -- could well have alerted a contemporary reader to the sonnet's place in a familiar rhetorical tradition, that concerned with persuading a young gentleman to marry in order to reproduce and thus secure his family line and its heritable property. (See Erasmus's "Epistle to persuade a young gentleman to marriage," excerpted in the Appendix, pages 619-24.) </p><p> While almost every line of the 154 sonnets begs for a comparable unpacking of Shakespeare's words, we will here limit ourselves to two additional examples, these from lines 2 and 4 of the same sonnet (Sonnet 1). First, the word <i>rose</i> in the phrase <i>beauty's rose</i> (line 2) engages the reader's mind and imagination at many levels. Most simply, it refers simultaneously to the rose blossom and the rosebush; this double signification, as Stephen Booth points out (see Further Reading), enables the sonnet to acknowledge that although the individual person, like the rose blossom, inevitably withers and dies, the family line, like the rosebush, lives on through continual <i>increase</i>. But the <i>rose</i> signifies as well that which is most beautiful in the natural world. (See, e.g., Isaiah 35.1: "The desert and the wilderness shall rejoice; the waste ground shall be glad and flourish as the rose.") And <i>beauty's rose</i> not only meant youthful beauty but also inevitably called up memories of the <i>Romance of the Rose</i> (widely published in Chaucer's translation), in which the <i>rose</i> stands allegorically for the goal of the lover's quest. (The fact that the lover in the <i>Romance</i> desires a specific unopened rosebud, rather than one of the rosebush's opened flowers, may have implications for the word <i>bud</i> in line 11.) </p><p> The word <i>rose</i>, then, gains its multiple resonances by referring to both a flower and its bush and through meanings accumulated in cultural and poetic traditions. In contrast, the particular verbal richness of the word <i>his</i> in line 4, "<i>His</i> tender heir might bear <i>his</i> memory" (and in many of the other sonnets), exists because Shakespeare took advantage of a language change in process at the very time he was writing. Until around 1600 the pronoun <i>his</i> served double duty, meaning both <i>his</i> and <i>its</i>. However, in the late 1590s and early 1600s, the word <i>its</i> came into existence as possessive of <i>it</i>, and <i>his</i> began gradually to be limited to the meaning it has today as the possessive of <i>he</i>. Because of the emerging gender implications of <i>his</i>, the pronoun as used in line 4, while primarily meaning <i>its</i> and thus referring to <i>beauty's rose</i>, also serves as a link between the sonnet's first line, where the <i>fairest</i> creature is not yet a <i>rose</i>, and the young man, first directly addressed in line 5. </p><p> Because the diction of the <i>Sonnets</i> is so incredibly rich in meanings, and because space for our facing-page notes is limited, we have had to curtail severely our notes on words with multiple meanings. Where the primary meaning of a word is clear and where secondary meanings are readily available or are not essential to an understanding of the poem, we all too often have had to remain silent. When it seems possible that a given word might have more than one relevant meaning, the reader should test out possible additional meanings and decide if they add richness to the line. The only hazard here is that some words have picked up new meanings since Shakespeare's death; careful study of the diction of his <i>Sonnets</i> thus compels one to turn to a dictionary based on historical principles, such as the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>. </p><p> </p><p> Shakespeare's Sentences </p><p> When Shakespeare made the decision to compose his <i>Sonnets</i> using the English (in contrast to the Italian) sonnet form, he seems at the same time to have settled on the shape of the <i>Sonnets</i>' sentences. The two forms are distinguished by rhyme scheme: in the Italian sonnet, the rhyme scheme in effect divides the poem into two sections, the eight-line <i>octave</i> followed by the six-line <i>sestet</i>; in the English, it sets three four-line quatrains in parallel, followed by the two-line rhyming couplet. While Shakespeare finds almost infinite ways to provide variety within the tightly controlled form of the English sonnet, and while the occasional sonnet is made up of a single sentence (e.g., Sonnet 29), his sentences tend to shape themselves within the bounds set by the quatrain and the couplet -- that is, most quatrains and most couplets are each made up of one sentence or question, with occasional quatrains made up of two or more sentences or questions. (Quatrains that, in modern printed editions, end with a semicolon rather than a period or question mark are often so marked only to indicate that the thought continues into the next quatrain; syntactically, the clause is generally independent and could be completed with a period instead.) The reader therefore seldom finds in the <i>Sonnets</i> the long, complicat...</p></p><h2>Java Illuminated</h2><p>Written for the one- to three-term introductory programming course, the fifth edition of Java Illuminated provides learners with an interactive, user-friendly approach to learning the Java programming language.

Guided in these botanical encounters by Francis Hall�, who has spent forty years in pursuit of the strange and beautiful plant specimens of the rainforest, the reader discovers a plant with just one solitary, monumental leaf; an invasive hyacinth; a tree that walks; a parasitic laurel; and a dancing vine. Further explorations reveal the <i>Rafflesia arnoldii</i>, the biggest flower in the world, with a crown of stamens and pistils the color of rotten meat that exude the stench of garbage in the summer sun; underground trees with leaves that form a carpet on the ground above them; and the biggest tree in Africa, which can reach seventy meters (more tha 200 feet) in height, with a four-meter (about 13 feet) diameter.

Garner</b><p>Based on the popular website, <b>Typography for Lawyers</b> is the first guide to the essentials of typography aimed specifically at lawyers. Author Matthew Butterick, an attorney and Harvard-trained typographer, dispels the myth that legal documents are incompatible with excellent typography. Butterick explains how to get professional results with the tools you already have quickly and easily. Topics include special keyboard characters, line length, point size, font choice, headings, and hyphenation. The book also includes tutorials on specific types of documents like r�sum�s, research memos, and motions.</p></p><p><b>Matthew Butterick</b> got his B.A. degree magna cum laude from Harvard University in visual &amp; environmental studies. Butterick's work is in the permanent collection of the Houghton Library at Harvard. Butterick started his career as a font designer and engineer, working for David Berlow and Matthew Carter on projects for Apple Computer, Microsoft, Ziff-Davis, and others. Neville Brody featured his work in FUSE, Brody's journal of experimental typography. Butterick designed Herald Gothic, Wessex, and the popular sans serif family Hermes.<br> At the beginning of the Internet era, Butterick moved to San Francisco and founded Atomic Vision, a website design and engineering company. Butterick and his staff created award-winning websites for Internet pioneers like CNET, Netscape, Verisign, and Wired magazine. Butterick lectured in the United States and Europe on website development and user-interface design.<br> Atomic Vision was acquired by open-source software developer Red Hat. Butterick was part of the management team behind Red Hat's successful IPO and its transition to Internet-based distribution.<br> Butterick attended UCLA law school and became a member of the California bar in 2007.

A quick, thorough guide, this text offers much to typographic novices and experts alike. The book begins with a litany of sound arguments about why typography matters, and why it should be looked at as crucial to the law profession. But needless to say, nearly all the advice presented herein is equally applicable to writers or any professional services-based small business, not to mention graphic designers, students, and type mavens. --Nick Cox, <i>Book Review: Typography for Lawyers</i><br><br>Butterick's premise is that typography in legal documents should be held to the same standards as any professionally published material, because legal documents are professionally published material. There's a wealth of information that I wish I had had access to long before now. ... That's why Typography for Lawyers is such a godsend. --Ernie Svenson, <i>Typography matters, especially for lawyers</i><br><br>Typography for Lawyers is filled with nuggets, rationales and mechanics to make our papers look better. No, they won't make a loser appeal into a winner, but like wearing a decent suit to court, or polishing your shoes, it's one less detriment and one more benefit. Butterick's point, and mine, is that there's no good reason not to do it as well as it can be done. The book is a quick read, and one to keep on hand for reference, kinda like the Blue Book, the Essential Chester Barnard and Strunk &amp; White. --Scott Grennfield, <i>Book Review: Typography for Lawyers</i></p><h2>104 Activities That Build: Self-Esteem, Teamwork, Communication, Anger Management, Self-Discovery, Coping Skills</h2><p>This popular book makes teaching and learning by playing games a simple and fun experience for everyone.

The stories do not necessarily take place at the same moment in time, but are they really one story?</p><p>Black and White is an interesting title for a book that aims to prove there&#39;s no such thing as black and white. But read on and you will see that irony and playful deception are running themes in this multidimensional, nonlinear picture story, which was awarded the 1991 Caldecott Medal. In it, a normal-looking cow contains a robber literally pointing at one of the plot&#39;s various possible outcomes, which remain tentative as long as they are formulated by young readers. Seeing new angles and clues every time they open the book, these readers will probably astound adult onlookers with their excitement and ease at navigating the unknown in a literary medium akin to interactive multimedia.David Macaulay is an award-winning author and illustrator whose books have sold millions of copies in the United States alone, and his work has been translated into a dozen languages.

In this &#x201c;living autobiography&#x201d; infused with warmth and humor, Deborah Levy critiques the roles that society assigns to us, and reflects on the politics of breaking with the usual gendered rituals. What does it cost a woman to unsettle old boundaries and collapse the social hierarchies that make her a minor character in a world not arranged to her advantage?</p><p>Levy draws on her own experience of attempting to live with pleasure, value, and meaning--the making of a new kind of family home, the challenges of her mother&#x2019;s death--and those of women she meets in everyday life, from a young female traveler reading in a bar who suppresses her own words while she deflects an older man&#x2019;s advances, to a particularly brilliant student, to a kindly and ruthless octogenarian bookseller who offers the author a place to write at a difficult time in her life. <i>The Cost of Living</i> is urgent, essential reading, a crystalline manifesto for turbulent times.</p></p><p><b>Deborah Levy,</b> <b>FRSL</b>, writes fiction, plays, and poetry. Her work has been staged by the Royal Shakespeare Company, widely broadcast on the BBC, and translated into fourteen languages. The author of highly praised novels, including <i>Hot Milk </i>and <i>Swimming Home</i> (both Man Booker Prize finalists), <i>The Unloved</i>, and<i> Billy and Girl</i>, the story collection <i>Black Vodka</i>, and the essay <i>Things I Don't Want to Know</i>,<i> </i>she lives in London.<p>"[Levy] is an indelible writer . . . [an] elliptical genius . . . <i>The Cost of Living </i>. . . is always a pleasure to consume." - <i>Dwight Garner, The New York Times</i></p><p>"An astute observer of both the mundane and the inexplicable, Levy sketches memorable details in just a few strokes . . . What makes the book stand out . . . is that Levy doesn&#x2019;t allow herself to linger over these details . . . She&#x2019;s like an expert rafter, and the river she travels is full of encounters and emotions. While another writer might give us a lengthy tour of this turbulent water, Levy doesn&#x2019;t slow down. There&#x2019;s joy in her maneuvering through the rapids, difficult though they may be. And there&#x2019;s joy for us in watching her." - <i>Yiyun Lee, The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>"Levy's style is fragmented, each anecdote as luminous, self-contained and hard as the pearls in the necklace she habitually wears around her throat. There's humor here and vulnerability . . . <i>The Cost of Living</i> is a smart, slim meditation on womanhood informed by Levy's wide reading." - <i>Maureen Corrigan, NPR&#x2019;s &#x201c;Fresh Air&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>"The Cost of Living</i> is unclassifiable, original, full of unexpected pleasures at every turn. Though it can be read in a flash, I suspect readers will want to savor this book slowly, for its many moments of insight, humor, wisdom, and surprise. Delivered in gorgeous, disciplined prose, Deborah Levy has crafted a bracing, searing inquiry into one woman&#x2019;s life that manages to tell the truth of all women&#x2019;s lives. I loved it." - <i>Dani Shapiro</i></p><p>"Levy would never tell another woman to live the way she does, or to live any one way at all. She's too sophisticated a feminist for that. Still, she wants us . . . to know that she's happy, that she's thriving in this new, uncharted life. Her work is, too. The last sentence of the book starts, &#x2018;The writing you are reading now is made from the cost of living.&#x2019; For writing this good, the cost of living is plainly the right price to pay." - <i>NPR.org</i></p><p>"An eloquent manifesto for what Levy calls &#x2018;a new way of living&#x2019; in the post-familial world." - <i>The Guardian</i></p><p>"This is a writer who has found her voice and her subject, and both speak directly to our times . . . Levy captivates us from her wonderful first sentence . . . If you want evidence that Levy&#x2019;s struggles to find a life that makes sense for her have paid off, this book is Exhibit A." - <i>The Los Angeles Times</i></p><p>"Extraordinary and beautiful. Ranging widely and deeply over marriage, motherhood, love, death and friendship, it is a work suffused with fierce intelligence, generous humanity and razor-sharp insights." - <i>The Financial Times</i></p><p>"Powerful." - <i>O, the Oprah Magazine</i></p><p><i>"</i>Not only a personal reflection but a meditation on what is demanded of women." - <i>Electric Literature, &#x201c;The 15 Best Non-Fiction Books of 2018&#x201d;</i><br><i></i><br><i>"</i>Spare, lucid, profound, Levy&#x2019;s book is an evaluation of the work of a writer and the work of being a woman in the world." - <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></p><p>She&#x2019;s the most delicious narrator . . . What makes Levy remarkable, beyond the endless pleasures of her sentences, is her resourcefulness and wit. "She&#x2019;s ingenious, practical and dryly amused, somehow outside herself enough to find the grim, telling humor in almost any situation. Her experience is interesting to her largely for what it reveals about society, rather than the other way round . . . This is a manifesto for a risky, radical kind of life, out of your depth but swimming all the same." - <i>The New Statesman</i></p><p>"Keen and moving . . . This timely look at how women are viewed (and often dismissed) by society will resonate with many readers, but particularly with those who have felt marginalized or undervalued." - <i>Starred review, Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"An elegant, candid meditation on the fraught journey to self-knowledge." - <i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>"A robust piece of writing about what gives humans purpose . . . It is a heady, absorbing read." - <i>The Evening Standard</i></p><p>"Levy, nearing the end of her fifties, is writing her life not for her peers but for a new generation. Since we tend to speak of feminism as coming in waves, separated by generation gaps (most recently the supposed rift between millennials and baby boomers), we often focus on what divides women. What if instead we saw all women as trying to understand themselves as major characters in a society that will grant them only the status of minor ones?" - <i>Harper's Magazine</i></p><p>"[A] beautiful yet damning indictment of how our culture effaces women&#x2019;s creative voices, both directly and insidiously." - <i>Library Journal</i></p><p>"A tender, vulnerable book with a fierce strength and intelligence at its core. We sense the courage and honesty Levy required to submerge herself, breath held, fully in the past in order to find her way into a new, altered present." - <i>Nadja Spiegelman</i></p><p>"Searching for something to read after devouring <i>Women and Power</i>? Known for her piquant novels, Deborah Levy now takes to non-fiction, with a 'working autobiography' that comprises thoughtful dissections of life as a woman." - <i>Elle Magazine, "Here Are the 21 Books We're Most Excited to Read in 2018"</i></p><p>"In this evocative and insightful memoir, Levy describes her new freedom, in all its complexity and drudgery, and examines how society&#x2019;s expectations can define and confine women . . . Levy deftly relates the circumstances of her new life with a bewitching combination of wit and pathos." - <i>Booklist</i></p><p>"How thrilling to read this vivid account by a brilliant woman leaving the marital and maternal <i>we </i>for scary freedom in the land of <i>I</i>. I loved this book!" - <i>Honor Moore</i></p><p>"Beautiful, elegiac . . . The power of words to bestow life after death, and the importance of choosing what is living over what is dead, are at the heart of Levy&#x2019;s exquisite prose." - <i>The Spectator</i></p><p>"An inherently fascinating, thoughtful and thought-provoking read from beginning to end, <i>The Cost of Living</i> is a compelling compilation of intensely personal stories so relevant to our turbulent times." - <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><p><i>"The Cost of Living</i> refers to the price a woman has to pay for unmaking the home she no longer feels at home in. In Levy&#x2019;s case, this radical act of erasure inaugurates a quest for a new life that is inseparable from the writing of a new narrative." - <i>The Irish Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;[Levy] packs astounding insight and clarity into every passage . . . If I could, I would buy these books for every woman I know.&#x201d; - <i>The Globe and Mail</i></p><p>"A memoir of a woman creating a new life after divorce and a collection of insightful musings on femininity, motherhood, and the craft and discipline of writing." - <i>Lilith Magazine</i></p><p>"A candid and raw offering from an author whose pain is matched by her exceptional talents as a writer." - <i>The Free Lance-Star</i></p><p>"Highly evocative and allusive." - <i>Vulture</i></p><p><i>"</i><i>The Cost of Living</i> is a sleight-of-hand masterpiece, a text full of unfathomable juxtapositions and curious segues . . .

Alexis de Tocqueville, a young French aristocrat, came to the young nation to investigate the functioning of American democracy and the social, political, and economic life of its citizens, publishing his observations in 1835 and 1840. Brilliantly written and vividly illustrated with vignettes and portraits, <i>Democracy in America</i> is far more than a trenchant analysis of one society at a particular point in time.

OLINSKI CHOSEN her sixth-grade Academic Bowl team? She had a number of answers. But were any of them true? How had she really chosen Noah and Nadia and Ethan and Julian? And why did they make such a good team? <br>It was a surprise to a lot of people when Mrs. Olinski's team won the sixth-grade Academic Bowl contest at Epiphany Middle School. It was an even bigger surprise when they beat the seventh grade and the eighth grade, too. And when they went on to even greater victories, everyone began to ask: How did it happen? <br>It happened at least partly because Noah had been the best man (quite by accident) at the wedding of Ethan's grandmother and Nadia's grandfather. It happened because Nadia discovered that she could not let a lot of baby turtles die. It happened when Ethan could not let Julian face disaster alone. And it happened because Julian valued something important in himself and saw in the other three something he also valued. <br>Mrs. Olinski, returning to teaching after having been injured in an automobile accident, found that her Academic Bowl team became her answer to finding confidence and success. What she did not know, at least at first, was that her team knew more than she did the answer to why they had been chosen. <br>This is a tale about a team, a class, a school, a series of contests and, set in the midst of this, four jewel-like short stories -- one for each of the team members -- that ask questions and demonstrate surprising answers.</p><p>A powerhouse sixth-grade Academic Bowl team from Epiphany Middle School; the art of calligraphy; the retirees of Century Village, Florida; a genius dog named Ginger; and a holiday production of "Annie" all figure heavily in the latest book by E.

Frankweiler</i>, which won the Newbery Medal almost 30 years ago. The new book centers around a group of four brilliant, shy 12-year-olds and the tea party they have each Saturday morning. Konigsburg's wacky erudition and her knack for offbeat characters make this a funny and endearing story of friendship.Mrs. Eva Marie Olinski is charged with appointing four students to represent her sixth-grade class in the Epiphany Middle School Academic Bowl competition. When these four students, calling themselves "The Souls," go on to win the state Academic Bowl Championship, Mrs. Olinski begins to realize that these four students who appear to have little in common on the surface have been on a journey that interlocked their lives like pieces of a puzzle.<br></p><h2>The Collected Short Stories of Louis L&#39;Amour, Volume 3: The Frontier Stories</h2><p>This third volume of Louis L'Amour's collected stories gathers twenty-eight tales of the American West in a keepsake edition sure to delight fans old and new.

Concentrating on buildings, tombs and statues, it also describes in detail the myths, religious beliefs and historical background behind the monuments considered. In doing so, it preserves Greek legends, quotes classical literature and poetry that would otherwise have been lost, and offers a fascinating depiction of the glory of classical Greece immediately before its third-century decline.

His Guide to Greece is an extremely comprehensive guide book for tourists, concentrating on buildings, tombs and statues and including a lot of information on the mythological, religious and historical background to the monuments described. It is so informative that it may be called the foundation of classical archaeology and this ancient Baedeker is still used as a guide to classical Greece.<b>Pausanias</b>&nbsp;was a Greek geographer and native of Lydia who explored Greece, Macedonia, Asia and Africa, before settling in Rome.

The book combines the 1692 translation of the <i>Fables</i> by English journalist Sir Roger L'Estrange with 50 drawings created especially as illustration for the tales by American sculptor, painter, and illustrator Alexander Calder. <br>L'Estrange's 17th-century rendering of the fables is a delight to read, judged by <i>The Cambridge History of English Literature</i> "the best that we have." Calder's art needs no special introduction: his widely displayed "mobiles" and "stabiles" have won him international popularity. The drawings Calder executed for this book rank among his most imaginative creations. <br>Two hundred and one of the traditional fables are narrated here, including such all-time favorites as "A Hare and a Tortoise," "A Fox and Grapes," "A Lyoness and a Fox," "A City Mouse and a Country Mouse," "A Swallow and a Crow," and "A Fox and a Raven."

I pictured myself pouring my heart out to this guy, ranting about the shadows, and the worms, and Korrok, and Fred Durst, babbling away under this wall-sized portrait of a badly drawn burrito. How was this going to turn into anything but a ridiculous clusterfuck?<br>Enough, I said to myself. Just go. When you&#x2019;re on your deathbed you&#x2019;re gonna wish you could get back all the time you spent waiting for other people.<br>I started to stand but stopped myself halfway up. My stomach flinched, as if cattle-prodded. I felt another dizzy spell coming on.<br>I fell hard back into the booth. More side effects. I was already light-headed, my body trembling from shoes to shoulders in random spells, like I swallowed a vibrator. It&#x2019;s always like this when I&#x2019;m on the sauce. I dosed six hours ago.<br>I took slow, deep breaths, trying to cycle down, to level off, to chill out. I turned to watch a little Asian waitress deliver a plate of chicken fried rice to a bearded guy on the other side of the room.<br>I squinted. In half a second I counted 5,829 grains of rice on her plate. The rice was grown in Arkansas. The guy who ran the harvester was nicknamed &#x201c;Cooter.&#x201d;<br>I&#x2019;m not a genius, as my dad and all my old teachers at Undisclosed Eastern High School will inform you with even the slightest provocation. I&#x2019;m not psychic, either. Just side effects, that&#x2019;s all.<br>The shakes again. A quick, fluttery wave, like the adrenaline rush you get when you lean your chair too far past the tipping point. Might as well wait it out, I guess. I was still waiting on my &#x201c;Flaming Shrimp Reunion,&#x201d; a dish I ordered just to see what it looked like. I wasn&#x2019;t hungry.<br>A flatware set was wrapped in a napkin on the table in front of me. A few inches away was my glass of iced tea; a few inches from that was another object, one I didn&#x2019;t feel like thinking about right then. I unwrapped my utensils. I closed my eyes and touched the fork, immediately knew it was manufactured in Pennsylvania six years ago, on a Thursday, and that a guy had once used it to scrape a piece of dog shit from his shoe.<br>You&#x2019;ve just gotta make it through a couple of days of this, said my own voice again from inside my skull. You&#x2019;ll open your eyes tomorrow or the next day and everything will be okay again. Well, mostly okay. You&#x2019;ll still be ugly and kind of stupid and you&#x2019;ll occasionally see things that make you&#x2014;<br>I did open my eyes, and jerked in shock. A man was sitting across from me in the booth. I hadn&#x2019;t heard or felt or smelled him when he slid into the seat. Was this the reporter I spoke to on the phone?<br>Or a ninja?<br>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; I mumbled. &#x201c;Are you Arnie?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yeah. Did you doze off there?&#x201d; He shook my hand.<br>&#x201c;Uh, no. I was just tryin&#x2019; to rub somethin&#x2019; off the back of my eyelid. I&#x2019;m David Wong. Good to meet ya.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sorry I&#x2019;m late.&#x201d;<br>Arnie Blondestone looked just like I imagined him. He was older, uneven haircut and a bad mustache, a wide face made for a cigar. He wore a gray suit that looked older than I was, a tie with a fat Windsor knot.<br>He had told me he was a reporter for a national magazine and wanted to do a feature on me and my friend John. It wasn&#x2019;t the first request like this, but it was the first one I had agreed to. I looked the guy up on the Web, found out he did quirky little human-interest bits, Charles Kuralt stuff. One article about a guy who obsessively collects old lightbulbs and paints landscapes on them, another about a lady with six hundred cats, that sort of thing. It&#x2019;s what polite people have instead of freak shows I guess, stories we can laugh at around the coffee machines in the office break room.<br>Arnie&#x2019;s gaze stayed on my face a little too long, taking in my beads of cold sweat, my pale skin, the thatch of overgrown hair. Instead of pointing out any of that, Arnie said, &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t look Asian, Mr. Wong.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not. I was born in [Undisclosed]. I had the name changed. Thought it would make me harder to find.&#x201d;<br>Arnie gave me the first of what I assumed would be many, many skeptical looks. &#x201c;How so?&#x201d;<br>I half closed my eyes, my mind flooding with images of the 103 billion humans who have been born since the species appeared. A sea of people living, dying and multiplying like cells in a single organism. I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to clear my mind by focusing on a mental image of the waitress&#x2019;s boobs.<br>I said, &#x201c;Wong is the most common surname in the world. You try to Google it, you&#x2019;ve got a shitload of results to sift through before you get to me.&#x201d;<br>He said, &#x201c;Okay. Your family live around here?&#x201d;<br>Getting right to it, then.<br>&#x201c;I was adopted. Never knew my real dad. You could be my dad, for all I know. Are you my dad?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Eh, I don&#x2019;t think so.&#x201d;<br>I tried to figure out if these were warm-up questions to prime the interview pump, or if he already knew. I suspected the latter.<br>Might as well go all-in. That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;re here, right?<br>&#x201c;My adopted family moved away, I won&#x2019;t tell you where they are. But get out your pen because you&#x2019;ll want to write this down. My biological mom? She was institutionalized.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That must have been hard. What was the&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;She was a strung-out, crank-addicted cannibal, dabbled in vampirism and shamanism. My mom, she worshipped some major devil when I was a toddler. Blew her welfare check every month on black candles. Sure, Satan would do her favors now and then, but there&#x2019;s always a catch with the Devil. Always a catch.&#x201d;<br>A pause from Arnie, then, &#x201c;Is that true?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No. This, this silliness, it&#x2019;s what I do when I&#x2019;m nervous. She was bipolar, that&#x2019;s all. Couldn&#x2019;t keep a house. Isn&#x2019;t the other story better, though? You should use it.&#x201d;<br>Arnie gave me a practiced look of reporterly sincerity and said, &#x201c;I thought you wanted to get the truth out, your side of it. If not, then why are we even here, Mr. Wong?&amp;rdq...</p></p><h2>Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup</h2><p><p><b>A <i>New York Times</i> Bestseller</b></p><p><b>Longlisted for the </b><b>Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award</b></p><p><b>'Chilling . . .

She is a professor at Brooklyn College and lives in New York City.1 <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>She shouldn&#x2019;t have been tempted. <br>This is what Kestrel thought as she swept the sailors&#x2019; silver off the impromptu gaming table set up in a corner of the market. <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t go,&#x201d; said one sailor. <br>&#x201c;Stay,&#x201d; said another, but Kestrel cinched her wrist-strap velvet purse shut. The sun had lowered, and caramelized the color of things, which meant that she had played cards long enough to be noticed by someone who mattered. <br>Someone who would tell her father. <br>Cards wasn&#x2019;t even her favorite game. The silver wouldn&#x2019;t begin to pay for her silk dress, snagged from the splintery crate she had used as a stool. But sailors were much better adversaries than the average aristocrat. They flipped cards with feral tricks, swore when they lost, swore when they won, would gouge the last silver keystone coin out of a friend. And they cheated. Kestrel especially liked it when they cheated. It made beating them not quite so easy. <br>She smiled and left them. Then her smile faded. This hour of thrilling risk was going to cost her. It wasn&#x2019;t the gambling that would infuriate her father, or the company she had kept. No, General Trajan was going to want to know why his daughter was in the city market alone. <br>Other people wondered, too. She saw it in their eyes as she threaded through market stalls offering open sacks of spice, the scents mingling with salty air that wafted from the nearby port. Kestrel guessed the words people didn&#x2019;t dare whisper as she passed. Of course they didn&#x2019;t speak. They knew who she was. And she knew what they would say. <br>Where was Lady Kestrel&#x2019;s escort? <br>And if she had no friend or family available to escort her to the market, where was her slave? <br>Well, as for a slave, they had been left at her villa. Kestrel did not need them. <br>As for the whereabouts of her escort, she was wondering the same thing. <br>Jess had wandered off to look at the wares. Kestrel last saw her weaving like a flower-drunk bee through the stalls, her pale blond hair almost white in the summer sun. Technically, Jess could get in as much trouble as Kestrel. It wasn&#x2019;t allowed for a young Valorian girl who wasn&#x2019;t a member of the military to walk alone. But Jess&#x2019;s parents doted on her, and they hardly had the same notion of discipline as the highest-ranking general in the Valorian army. <br>Kestrel scanned the stalls for her friend, and finally caught the gleam of blond braids styled in the latest fashion. Jess was talking to a jewelry seller who dangled a pair of earrings. The translucent gold droplets caught the light. <br>Kestrel drew closer. <br>&#x201c;Topaz,&#x201d; the elderly woman was saying to Jess. &#x201c;To brighten your lovely brown eyes. Only ten keystones.&#x201d; <br>There was a hard set to the jewelry seller&#x2019;s mouth. Kestrel met the woman&#x2019;s gray eyes and noticed that her wrinkled skin was browned from years of working outdoors. She was Herrani, but a brand on her wrist proved that she was free. Kestrel wondered how she had earned that freedom. Slaves freed by their masters were rare. <br>Jess glanced up. &#x201c;Oh, Kestrel,&#x201d; she breathed. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t these earrings perfect?&#x201d; <br>Maybe if the weight of silver in Kestrel&#x2019;s purse hadn&#x2019;t dragged at her wrist she would have said nothing. Maybe if that drag at her wrist hadn&#x2019;t also dragged at her heart with dread, Kestrel would have thought before she spoke. But instead she blurted what was the obvious truth. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re not topaz. They&#x2019;re glass.&#x201d; <br>There was a sudden bubble of silence. It expanded, grew thin and sheer. People around them were listening. The earrings trembled in midair. <br>Because the jewelry seller&#x2019;s bony fingers were trembling. <br>Because Kestrel had just accused her of trying to cheat a Valorian. <br>And what would happen next? What would happen to any Herrani in this woman&#x2019;s position? What would the crowd witness? <br>An officer of the city guard called to the scene. A plea of innocence, ignored. Old hands bound to the whipping post. Lashes until blood darkened the market dirt. <br>&#x201c;Let me see,&#x201d; Kestrel said, her voice imperious, because she was very good at being imperious. She reached for the earrings and pretended to examine them. &#x201c;Ah. It seems I was mistaken. Indeed they <i>are</i> topaz.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Take them,&#x201d; whispered the jewelry seller. <br>&#x201c;We are not poor. We have no need of a gift from someone such as you.&#x201d; Kestrel set coins on the woman&#x2019;s table. The bubble of silence broke, and shoppers returned to discussing whatever ware had caught their fancy. <br>Kestrel gave the earrings to Jess and led her away. <br>As they walked, Jess studied one earring, letting it swing like a tiny bell. &#x201c;So they <i>are</i> real?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How can you tell?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re completely unclouded,&#x201d; Kestrel said. &#x201c;No flaws. Ten keystones was too cheap a price for topaz of that quality.&#x201d; <br>Jess might have commented that ten keystones was too great a price for glass. But she said only, &#x201c;The Herrani would say that the god of lies must love you, you see things so clearly.&#x201d; <br>Kestrel remembered the woman&#x2019;s stricken gray eyes. &#x201c;The Herrani tell too many stories.&#x201d; They had been dreamers. Her father always said that this was why they had been easy to conquer. <br>&#x201c;Everyone loves stories,&#x201d; Jess said. <br>Kestrel stopped to take the earrings from Jess and slip them into her friend&#x2019;s ears. &#x201c;Then wear these to the next society dinner. Tell everyone you paid an outrageous sum, and they will believe they&#x2019;re true jewels. Isn&#x2019;t that what stories do, make real things fake, and fake things real?&#x201d; <br>Jess smiled, turning her head from side to side so that the earrings glittered. &#x201c;Well? Am I beautiful?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Silly. You know you are.&#x201d; <br>Jess led the way now, slipping past a table with brass bowls holding powdered dye. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my turn to buy something for you,&#x201d; she said. <br>&#x201c;I have everything I need.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You sound like an old woman! One would think you&#x2019;re seventy, not seventeen.&#x201d; <br>The crowd was thicker now, filled with the golden features of Valorians, hair and skin and eyes ranging from honey tones to light brown. The occasional dark heads belonged to well-dressed house slaves, who had come with their masters and stayed close to their sides. <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t look so troubled,&#x201d; Jess said. &#x201c;Come, I will find something to make you happy. A bracelet?&#x201d; <br>But that reminded Kestrel of the jewelry seller. &#x201c;We should go home.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sheet music?&#x201d; <br>Kestrel hesitated. <br>&#x201c;Aha,&#x201d; said Jess. She seized Kestrel&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let go.&#x201d; <br>This was an old game. Kestrel closed her eyes and was tugged blindly after Jess, who laughed, and then Kestrel laughed, too, as she had years ago when they first met. <br>The general had been impatient with his daughter&#x2019;s mourning. &#x201c;Your mother&#x2019;s been dead half a year,&#x201d; he had said. &#x201c;That is long enough.&#x201d; Finally, he had had a senator in a nearby villa bring his daughter, also eight years old, to visit. The men went inside Kestrel&#x2019;s house. The girls were told to stay outside. &#x201c;Play,&#x201d; the general had ordered. <br>Jess had chattered at Kestrel, who ignored her. Finally, Jess stopped. &#x201c;Close your eyes,&#x201d; she said. <br>Curious, Kestrel did. <br>Jess had grabbed her hand. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let go!&#x201d; They tore over the general&#x2019;s grassy grounds, slipping and tumbling and laughing. <br>It was like that now, except for the press of people around them. <br>Jess slowed. Then she stopped and said, &#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; <br>Kestrel opened her eyes. <br>The girls had come to a waist-high wooden barrier that overlooked a pit below. &#x201c;You brought me <i>here</i>?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean to,&#x201d; said Jess. &#x201c;I got distracted by a woman&#x2019;s hat&#x2014;did <i>you</i> know hats are in fashion?&#x2014;and was following to get a better look, and&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And brought us to the slave market.&#x201d; The crowd had congealed behind them, noisy with restless anticipation. There would be an auction soon. <br>Kestrel stepped back. She heard a smothered oath when her heel met someone&#x2019;s toes. <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll never get out now,&#x201d; Jess said. &#x201c;We might as well stay until the auction&#x2019;s over.&#x201d; <br>Hundreds of Valorians were gathered before the barrier, which curved in a wide semicircle. Everyone in the crowd was dressed in silks, each with a dagger strapped to the hip, though some&#x2014;like Jess&#x2014;wore it more as an ornamental toy than a weapon. <br>The pit below was empty, save for a large wooden auction block. <br>&#x201c;At least we have a good view.&#x201d; Jess shrugged. <br>Kestrel knew that Jess understood why her friend had claimed loudly that the glass earrings were topaz. Jess understood why they had been purchased. But the girl&#x2019;s shrug reminded Kestrel that there were certain things they couldn&#x2019;t discuss. <br>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; said a pointy-chinned woman at Kestrel&#x2019;s side. &#x201c;At last.&#x201d; Her eyes narrowed on the pit and the stocky man walking into its center. He was Herrani, with the typical black hair, though his skin was pale from an easy life, no doubt due to the same favoritism that had gotten him this job. This was someone who had learned how to please his Valorian conquerors. <br>The auctioneer stood in front of the block. <br>&#x201c;Show us a girl first,&#x201d; called the woman at Kestrel&#x2019;s side, her voice both loud and languid. <br>Many voices were shouting now, each calling for what they wanted to see. Kestrel found it hard to breathe. <br>&#x201c;A girl!&#x201d; yelled the pointy-chinned woman, this time more loudly. <br>The auctioneer, who had been sweeping his hands toward him as if gathering the cries and excitement, paused when the woman&#x2019;s shout cut through the noise. He glanced at her, then at Kestrel. A flicker of surprise seemed to show on his face. She thought that she must have imagined it, for he skipped on to Jess, then peered in a full semicircle at all the Valorians against the barrier above and around him. <br>He raised a hand. Silence fell. &#x201c;I have something very special for you.&#x201d; <br>The acoustics of the pit were made to carry a whisper, and the auctioneer knew his trade. His soft voice made everyone lean closer. <br>His hand shifted to beckon toward the open, yet roofed and shadowed structure built low and small at the back of the pit. He twitched his fingers once, then twice, and something stirred in the holding pen. <br>A young man stepped out. <br>The crowd murmured. Bewilderment grew as the slave slowly paced across the yellow sand. He stepped onto the auction block. <br>This was nothing special. <br>&#x201c;Nineteen years old, and in fine condition.&#x201d; The auctioneer clapped the slave on the back. &#x201c;This one,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;would be perfect for the house.&#x201d; <br>Laughter rushed through the crowd. Valorians nudged each other and praised the auctioneer. He knew how to entertain. <br>The slave was bad goods. He looked, Kestrel thought, like a brute. A deep bruise on the slave&#x2019;s cheek was evidence of a fight and a promise that he would be difficult to control. His bare arms were muscular, which likely only confirmed the crowd&#x2019;s belief that he would be best working for someone with a whip in hand. Perhaps in another life he could have been groomed for a house; his hair was brown, light enough to please some Valorians, and while his features couldn&#x2019;t be discerned from Kestrel&#x2019;s distance, there was a proud line in the way he stood. But his skin was bronzed from outdoor labor, and surely it was to such work that he would return. He might be purchased by someone who needed a dockworker or a builder of walls. <br>Yet the auctioneer kept up his joke. &#x201c;He could serve at your table.&#x201d; <br>More laughter. <br>&#x201c;Or be your valet.&#x201d; <br>Valorians held their sides and fluttered their fingers, begging the auctioneer to stop, stop, he was too funny. <br>&#x201c;I want to leave,&#x201d; Kestrel told Jess, who pretended not to hear. <br>&#x201c;All right, all right.&#x201d; The auctioneer grinned. &#x201c;The lad does have some real skills. On my honor,&#x201d; he added, laying a hand over his heart, and the crowd chuckled again, for it was common knowledge that there was no such thing as Herrani honor. &#x201c;This slave has been trained as a blacksmith. He would be perfect for any soldier, especially for an officer with a guard of his own and weapons to maintain.&#x201d; <br>There was a murmur of interest. Herrani blacksmiths were rare. If Kestrel&#x2019;s father were here, he would probably bid. His guard had long complained about the quality of the city blacksmith&#x2019;s work. <br>&#x201c;Shall we start the bidding?&#x201d; said the auctioneer. &#x201c;Five pilasters. Do I hear five bronze pilasters for the boy? Ladies and gentlemen, you could not <i>hire</i> a blacksmith for so little.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Five,&#x201d; someone called. <br>&#x201c;Six.&#x201d; <br>And the bidding began in earnest. <br>The bodies at Kestrel&#x2019;s back might as well have been stone. She couldn&#x2019;t move. She couldn&#x2019;t look at the expressions of her people. She couldn&#x2019;t catch the attention of Jess, or stare into the too-bright sky. These were all the reasons, she decided, why it was impossible to gaze anywhere else but at the slave. <br>&#x201c;Oh, come now,&#x201d; said the auctioneer. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s worth at least ten.&#x201d; <br>The slave&#x2019;s shoulders stiffened. The bidding continued. <br>Kestrel closed her eyes. When the price reached twenty-five pilasters, Jess said, &#x201c;Kestrel, are you ill?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll leave as soon as it&#x2019;s over. It won&#x2019;t be long now.&#x201d; <br>There was a lull in the bidding. It appeared the slave would go for twenty-five pilasters, a pitiful price, yet as much as anyone was willing to pay for a person who would soon be worked into uselessness. <br>&#x201c;My dear Valorians,&#x201d; said the auctioneer. &#x201c;I have forgotten one thing. Are you sure he wouldn&#x2019;t make a fine house slave? Because this lad can sing.&#x201d; <br>Kestrel opened her eyes. <br>&#x201c;Imagine music during dinner, how charmed your guests will be.&#x201d; The auctioneer glanced up at the slave, who stood tall on his block. &#x201c;Go on. Sing for them.&#x201d; <br>Only then did the slave shift position. It was a slight movement and quickly stilled, but Jess sucked in her breath as if she, like Kestrel, expected a fight to break out in the pit below. <br>The auctioneer hissed at the slave in rapid Herrani, too quietly for Kestrel to understand. <br>The slave answered in his language. His voice was low: &#x201c;No.&#x201d; <br>Perhaps he didn&#x2019;t know the acoustics of the pit. Perhaps he didn&#x2019;t care, or worry that any Valorian knew at least enough Herrani to understand him. No matter. The auction was over now. No one would want him. Probably the person who had offered twenty-five pilasters was already regretting a bid for someone so intractable that he wouldn&#x2019;t obey even his own kind. <br>But his refusal touched Kestrel. The stony set of the slave&#x2019;s shoulders reminded her of herself, when her father demanded something that she couldn&#x2019;t give. <br>The auctioneer was furious.

Toklas.</p><p>These days Gertrude Stein is remembered mainly for the notorious "autobiography" she wrote with her lover and long-time companion, Alice B. Toklas. Yet <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i> is only a sliver of that remarkable woman's literary output. Courted during the '20s, dismissed by critics in the '30s, rehabilitated in the '50s, Stein's reputation has ebbed and flowed with every new generation of readers. Now, however, the Library of America has given her its official stamp of approval as a Great American Writer by dedicating its 99th and 100th volumes to collecting together her voluminous works. Volume 1 covers Stein's work between the years 1903 and 1932 and includes a fascinating mix of previously unpublished prose (her 1903 novel <i>Q.E.D.</i>, theater work such as <i>Four Saints in Three Acts</i>, and of course, her poetry, experimental prose, lectures, and essays). For Gertrude Stein aficionados, this collection is a welcome and long-awaited event.Gertrude Stein was born in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, on February 3, 1874, to an affluent Jewish family, spent her early childhood in Vienna and Paris, and later grew up in Oakland, California. At Radcliffe College she studied under William James, who remained her lifelong friend, and then went to Johns Hopkins to study medicine. Abandoning her studies, she moved to Paris with her brother Leo in 1903. At 27 rue de Fleurus, Gertrude Stein lived with Alice B. Toklas, who would remain her companion for forty years. Not only was she an innovator in literature and a supporter of modern poetry and art, she was the friend and mentor of those who visited her at her now-famous home: Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Jean Cocteau, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sherwood Anderson, and Guillaume Appollinaire. Her first important book was <b>Three Lives</b> (1909), then <b>Tender Buttons</b> (1914), followed by her magnum opus, <b>The Making of Americans</b> (1925), and the book which became a huge popular success, <b>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</b> (1933). Just before her death at the age of 72 on July 27, 1946, she asked Alice Toklas from her hospital bed, &#x201c;What is the answer?&#x201d; Getting no answer, she then asked, &#x201c;In that case, what is the question?&#x201d;</p><h2>The Rise of the Western World: A New Economic History</h2><p>First published in 1973, this is a radical interpretation, offering a unified explanation for the growth of Western Europe between 900 A.

D. and 1700, provides a general theoretical framework for institutional change geared to the general reader.In some respects this is intended to be a revolutionary book, but in other respects it is very traditional indeed. It is revolutionary in that we have developed a comprehensive analytical framework to examine and explain the rise of the Western world; a framework consistent with and complementary to standard neo-classical economic theory. Since the book is written to be understandable (and hopefully interesting) for those without prior economic training, we have avoided the jargon of the profession and attempted to be as clear and as straightforward as possible.</p><h2>Planning and Community Development: A Guide for the 21st Century</h2><p><p><strong>An ideal introduction to community planning for students, planners, local officials, community leaders, and citizens.</strong></p> Two experienced educators offer a general introduction to planning, including the elements of the comprehensive plan, and the tools of plan implementation.

This book deliberately preserves the tone and style of a retreat, including soundings of the bell, meditation breaks, and the question-and-answer sessions. This not only provides a genuine feeling of a retreat for those who have not had the chance to participate in one, but it also preserves this wonderful practice time for those who have attended. In <i>The Path of Emancipation</i>, Thich Nhat Hanh translates the Buddhist tradition into everyday life and makes it relevant and transforming for us all. Studying in-depth the Discourse on the Full Awareness of Breathing, he teaches how mindfulness can help us reduce stress, and live simply, confidently, and happily while dwelling in the present moment.</p><p>Thich Nhat Hanh is one of the most revered Zen teachers in the world today.

It combines biblical data on sexuality and relationships with marriage and bonding research. The reader is then guided in applying the research to his or her relationships. In essence, this is a handbook for understanding and deepening the stages involved in bonding or attaching closely to another human being. Marriage, the most intimate of all human relationships, is described in Scripture as a &#34;one-flesh mystery&#34; (Eph 5:31-32). This mystery of human bonding is as beautiful as it is complex, particularly in a post-Eden world. Many of us are woefully aware of our relational deficits, yet lack vibrant marriages around us to emulate. Those of us who have not experienced relationships of health, safety, and security particularly find we need roadmaps along the way. Our desire is that in the pages of this book readers will find personal encouragement and direction that is both biblically precise and practical for their relational journeys. Our intimacy model is built upon God&#39;s bold promises to heal and redeem. His pathways bring life; he is the one true lover of our souls. Our intimacy with him is foundational to all other relationships.</p><p></p><h2>His Dark Materials: The Subtle Knife (Book 2)</h2><p><b><b><i>HIS DARK MATERIALS </i>IS NOW AN HBO ORIGINAL SERIES STARRING DAFNE KEEN, RUTH WILSON, JAMES McAVOY, AND LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA!</b><br><br>The spellbinding sequel to <i>The Golden Compass</i>, the modern fantasy classic that&nbsp;<i>Entertainment Weekly</i> named an "All-Time Greatest Novel" and <i>Newsweek</i> hailed as a "Top 100 Book of All Time," continues the epic adventure, catapulting readers between worlds, and toward a devastating discovery.</b><br><br>Lost in a new world, Lyra finds Will&#x2014;a boy on the run, a murderer&#x2014;a worthy and welcome ally.

Critics lobbed around such superlatives as "elegant," "awe-inspiring," "grand," and "glittering," and used "magnificent" with gay abandon. Each reader had a favorite chapter--or, more likely, several--from the opening tour de force to Lyra's close call at Bolvangar to the great armored-bear battle. And Pullman was no less profligate when it came to intellectual firepower or singular characters. The d�mons alone grant him a place in world literature. Could the second installment of his trilogy keep up this pitch, or had his heroine and her too, too sullied parents consumed him? And what of the belief system that pervaded his alternate universe, not to mention the mystery of Dust? More revelations and an equal number of wonders and new players were definitely in order.<p> <i>The Subtle Knife</i> offers everything we could have wished for, and more. For a start, there's a young hero--from our world--who is a match for Lyra Silvertongue and whose destiny is every bit as shattering. Like Lyra, Will Parry has spent his childhood playing games. Unlike hers, though, his have been deadly serious. This 12-year-old long ago learned the art of invisibility: if he could erase himself, no one would discover his mother's increasing instability and separate them. </p><p> As the novel opens, Will's enemies will do anything for information about his missing father, a soldier and Arctic explorer who has been very much airbrushed from the official picture. Now Will must get his mother into safe seclusion and make his way toward Oxford, which may hold the key to John Parry's disappearance. But en route and on the lam from both the police and his family's tormentors, he comes upon a cat with more than a mouse on her mind: "She reached out a paw to pat something in the air in front of her, something quite invisible to Will." What seems to him a patch of everyday Oxford conceals far more: "The cat stepped forward and vanished." Will, too, scrambles through and into another oddly deserted landscape--one in which children rule and adults (and felines) are very much at risk. Here in this deathly silent city by the sea, he will soon have a dustup with a fierce, flinty little girl: "Her expression was a mixture of the very young--when she first tasted the cola--and a kind of deep, sad wariness." Soon Will and Lyra (and, of course, her d�mon, Pantalaimon) uneasily embark on a great adventure and head into greater tragedy.</p><p> As Pullman moves between his young warriors and the witch Serafina Pekkala, the magnetic, ever-manipulative Mrs. Coulter, and Lee Scoresby and his hare d�mon, Hester, there are clear signs of approaching war and earthly chaos. There are new faces as well. The author introduces Oxford dark-matter researcher Mary Malone; the Latvian witch queen Ruta Skadi, who "had trafficked with spirits, and it showed"; Stanislaus Grumman, a shaman in search of a weapon crucial to the cause of Lord Asriel, Lyra's father; and a serpentine old man whom Lyra and Pan can't quite place. Also on hand are the Specters, beings that make cliff-ghasts look like rank amateurs. </p><p> Throughout, Pullman is in absolute control of his several worlds, his plot and pace equal to his inspiration. Any number of astonishing scenes--small- and large-scale--will have readers on edge, and many are cause for tears. "You think things have to be <i>possible</i>," Will demands. "Things have to be <i>true</i>!" It is Philip Pullman's gift to turn what quotidian minds would term the impossible into a reality that is both heartbreaking and beautiful. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>"JUST AS QUICK-MOVING AND UNPUTDOWNABLE AS [THE GOLDEN COMPASS] . . .

In his earlier book, <i>The Poetics of Space, </i>Bachelard considered several kinds of "praiseworthy space" conducive to the flow of poetic imagery. In <i>Poetics of Reverie </i>he considers the absolute origins of that imagery: language, sexuality, childhood, the Cartesian ego, and the universe. Approaching the psychology of wonder from the phenomenological viewpoint, Bachelard demonstrates the aurgentative <i>potential </i>of all that awareness. Thus he distinguishes what is merely a phenomenon of relaxation from the kind of reverie which "poetry puts on the right track, the track of expanding consciousness"</p></p><p>Gaston Bachelard (1884-1963) is the author of<i> The Poetics of Space</i>, <i>The Psychoanalysis of Fire</i>, and <i>The New Scientific Spirit</i>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>The Story of King Arthur and His Knights (Dover Children&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>In this enchanting version of the story of King Arthur, the renowned American illustrator and storyteller Howard Pyle displays his unique talent for capturing and stimulating the imaginations of the young. Inventively retold and vividly illustrated, these stories describe the perilous and thrilling adventures of King Arthur and his knights in that glorious age of chivalry and honor. <br>After showing how Arthur established his right to the throne by drawing the sword from the anvil, the author then relates the story of Arthur's battle with the Sable Knight and his securing the sword Excalibur &#x2015; "the most beautiful and the most famous sword in all the world." He tells of Arthur's confrontations with the Duke of North Umber and Sir Pellias, describes King Arthur's wooing and wedding the Lady Guinevere, and tells of the establishment of the Round Table. Tales are told, too, of Arthur's knights, including Merlin the Wise, Sir Pellias (or the Gentle Knight) and of course, Sir Gawaine. One of the key points in the book is Arthur's search for the answer to the riddle "What is it that a woman most desires?" with his life at stake. <br>This is the definitive children's version of the Arthurian legend, for generations a special&nbsp;favorite with youngsters of all ages. Its reputation, richly&nbsp;deserved, rests as much upon the illustrations as on the delightful tales themselves. And no wonder, for as an illustrator of children's books, Pyle had no peer. Bold and unforgettable as only Pyle's skilled hand could make them, these drawings convey at a glance the whole aura of that splendid age and&nbsp;help to make this a book that boys and girls will cherish for years to come. <br>These stories have inspired numerous film adaptations, including the 2017 release <i>King Arthur: Legend of the Sword</i>, directed by Guy Ritchie and starring Charlie Hunnam, Jude Law, Eric Bana, Djimon Hounsou, and Annabelle Wallis.</p><p>The stories and drawings of Howard Pyle (1853-1911) epitomize &#34;the golden age of American illustration.&#34; A priceless contribution to American children&#39;s literature, Pyle&#39;s work set a standard of excellence, with tales and images remarkable for their engaging simplicity and penetrating realism.If one is ready to take the plunge into intricate and antiquated language and to attend to the genealogy of each character and the minute details of each episode, then one will come away highly satisfied and steeped in knowledge of Arthur's early years. David Thorn is a masterful narrator. As his accent transports us to the British Isles, his pacing and conversational tone provide an intimate link to the characters. Thorn's characterizations are distinctive. He creates an ethereal Merlin, mystical Ladies from the Lake, an unassuming yet regal Arthur, a scheming Morgan le Fay, and a gracious Sir Pellias. From the moment Arthur is entrusted to Merlin until the quest for the white hart, the stories are riveting.

But who is the protagonist of that history that is coming&#x2014;or has come&#x2014;to a close? What is man? How did he come on the scene? And how has he maintained his privileged place as the master of, or first among, the animals? In <i>The Open</i>, contemporary Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben considers the ways in which the "human" has been thought of as either a distinct and superior type of animal, or a kind of being that is essentially different from animal altogether. In an argument that ranges from ancient Greek, Christian, and Jewish texts to twentieth-century thinkers such as Heidegger, Benjamin, and Koj�ve, Agamben examines the ways in which the distinction between man and animal has been manufactured by the logical presuppositions of Western thought, and he investigates the profound implications that the man/animal distinction has had for disciplines as seemingly disparate as philosophy, law, anthropology, medicine, and politics.</p><p>Giorgio Agamben is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Venice. This is the fifth of his books published by Stanford; previous titles are <i>Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life</i> (1998), <i>The Man Without Content</i> (1999), <i>The End of the Poem</i> (1999), and <i>Potentialities</i> (1999)."[<i>The Open</i>] turns to perhaps the most basic distinction of existence: that between human beings and animals. The thin volume provides an impressive historical survey of the problem, offering a dizzying scope of debate over the nature of animality, including expositions of figures as diverse as Thomas Aquinas, Georges Bataille, Heidegger, Alexander Koj�ve, Benjamin, and the German zoologist Jakob von Uexk�ll."

These provide the basis for a detailed critical study of the principal individual thinkers of the time. Besides serving as an essential text for undergraduate and graduate courses in Greek philosophy and in the history of science, this book will appeal to a wide range of readers with interests in philosophy, theology, the history of ideas and of the ancient world, and indeed to anyone who wants an authoritative account of the Presocratics.</p><p>Beginning with a revised introduction surveying the predecessors of the Presocratics, this new edition traces the intellectual revolution initiated by Thales in the early 6th century B.C. to its culmination in the metaphysics of Parmenides and the physical theories of Anaxagoras and the Atomists of the fifth century.</p><h2>Iza&#39;s Ballad (New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p>From the author of <i>The Door</i>, selected by <i>The New York Times Book Review </i>as one of the ten best books of 2015<br><br>An NYRB Classics Original<br><br>Like Magda Szab�&#x2019;s internationally acclaimed novel <i>The Door</i>, <i>Iza&#x2019;s Ballad</i> is a striking story of the relationship between two women, in this case a mother and a daughter. Ettie, the mother, is old and from an older world than the rapidly modernizing Communist Hungary of the years after World War II. From a poor family and without formal education, Ettie has devoted her life to the cause of her husband, Vince, a courageous magistrate who had been blacklisted for political reasons before the war. Iza, their daughter, is as brave and conscientious as her father: Active in the resistance against the Nazis, she is now a doctor and a force for progress. Iza lives and works in Budapest, and when Vince dies, she is quick to bring Ettie to the city to make sure her mother is close and can be cared for. She means to do everything right, and Ettie is eager to do everything to the satisfaction of the daughter she is so proud of. But good intentions aside, mother and daughter come from two different worlds and have different ideas of what it means to lead a good life. Though they struggle to accommodate each other, increasingly they misunderstand and hurt each other, and the distance between them widens into an abyss. . . .</p><p><b>Magda Szab�</b> (1917&#x2013;2007) was born into an old Protestant family in Debrecen, Hungary&#x2019;s &#x201c;Calvinist Rome,&#x201d; in the midst of the great Hungarian plain. Szab�, whose father taught her to converse with him in Latin, German, English, and French, attended the University of Debrecen, studying Latin and Hungarian, and went on to work as a teacher throughout the German and Soviet occupations of Hungary in 1944 and 1945. In 1947, she published two volumes of poetry, <i>B�r�ny</i> (The Lamb), and <i>Vissza az emberig</i> (Return to Man), for which she received the Baumgartner Prize in 1949. Under Communist rule, this early critical success became a liability, and Szab� turned to writing fiction: Her first novel, <i>Fresk�</i> (Fresco), came out in 1958, followed closely by <i>Az &#x151;z </i>(<i>The Fawn</i>). In 1959 she won the J�zsef Attila Prize, after which she went on to write many more novels, among them <i>Katalin utca </i>(Katalin Street, 1969), <i>�k�t </i>(The Ancient Well, 1970), <i>R�gim�di t�rt�net</i> (An Old-Fashioned Tale, 1971), and <i>Az ajt� </i>(<i>The Door</i>, 1987). In 2015, the first American publication of <i>The Door</i> was named one of ten best books of the year by <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>. Szab� also wrote verse for children, plays, short stories, and nonfiction, including a tribute to her husband, Tibor Szobotka, a writer and translator who died in 1982. A member of the European Academy of Sciences and a warden of the Calvinist Theological Seminary in Debrecen, Szab� died in the town in which she was born, a book in her hand. <br><br><b>George Szirtes</b> is a poet and translator of Hungarian literature.

Beidler</b><br><br> This book was originally published in 1933. It is the first novel by William March, pen name for William Edward Campbell. Stemming directly from the author's experiences with the US&nbsp;Marines in France during World War I, the book consists of 113 sketches, or chapters, tracing the fictional Company K's war exploits and providing an emotional history of the men of the company that extends beyond the boundaries of the war itself.<br><br> William Edward Campbell served courageously in France as evidenced by his chestful of medals and certificates, including the Croix de Guerre, the Distinguished Service Cross, and the Navy Cross. However, without the medals and citations we would know of his bravery. For it is clear in the pages of <i>Company K</i> that this book was written by a man who had been to war, who had clearly seen his share of the worst of it, who had somehow survived, and who had committed himself afterward to the new bravery of sense-making embodied in the creation of major literary art. It is of that bravery that we still have the record of magnificent achievement, the brave terrible gift of Company K.</p><p>A native of Mobile, AL<b>, William March</b> (1893-1954) studied law at The University of Alabama.

Among its 113 characters, every military type is represented&#x2014;the good soldier, the coward, the goldbrick, the rank-happy shavetail, the lucky, and the wound-prone.

There they retrieve an innocent-looking book that proves to be a rare and secret text stolen from a Nanking monastery, containing lethal martial arts techniques forbidden to the West. With the political situation between the British Empire and Imperial China already unstable, the duo must not only track down a killer intent upon gaining the secret knowledge but also safeguard the text from a snarl of suspects with conflicting interests. <br> <br> Prowling through an underworld of opium dens, back-room blood sports, and sailors' penny hangs while avoiding the wrath of the district's powerful warlord, Mr. K'ing, Barker and Llewelyn take readers on a perilous tour through the mean streets of turn-of-the-century London.</p><p><b>Will Thomas</b> is the author of <i>Some Danger Involved,</i> the first novel featuring Cyrus Barker and Thomas Llewelyn, and now a Barry and Shamus Award nominee. He lives with his family in Oklahoma.*Starred Review* The streets of turn-of-the-century London teem with trouble in this third offering in Thomas' atmospheric series (following <i>To Kingdom Come,</i> 2005). Stoic Scottish private-enquiry agent Cyrus Barker remains haunted by the mysterious death of his loyal assistant, Quong, who left a tattered pawn ticket among his effects. With his new right-hand man, Welshman Thomas Llewelyn, Barker exchanges the ticket for a rare Chinese text containing secret martial-arts techniques so lethal that others are willing to, well, kill for them. "(It is a rather special manual," Barker explains to a constable at Scotland Yard. "It teaches, for one thing, a way to disrupt the body's internal functions, killing someone without a sign.") With its ominous opium dens and dark-hearted thugs, London's Chinatown district, called Limehouse, is a forbidding place. But Barker, who once served in battle on behalf of the Chinese, is able to navigate it with the help of some influential friends, including tattooed restaurant owner Ho, whose personal history is as unsavory as his establishment's cuisine. Narrated by plucky Llewelyn, the novel features a memorable cast of characters, from a monocled dandy named Woo to tart-tongued shopkeeper Hettie Petulengro, who gives the unsuspecting detectives a spirited dressing-down. A wholly satisfying twist ends this outstanding entry in what is fast becoming one of the genre's best historical-mystery series. <i>Allison Block</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

First published in 1853, <i>Villette</i> is Bronte's most accomplished and deeply felt work, eclipsing even <i>Jane Eyre</i> in critical acclaim. Her narrator, the autobiographical Lucy Snowe, flees England and a tragic past to become an instructor in a French boarding school in the town of Villette. There, she unexpectedly confronts her feelings of love and longing as she witnesses the fitful romance between Dr. John, a handsome young Englishman, and Ginerva Fanshawe, a beautiful coquetter. This first pain brings others, and with them comes the heartache Lucy has tried so long to escape. Yet in spite of adversity and disappointment, Lucy Snowe survives to recount the unstinting vision of a turbulent life's journey--a journey that is one of the most insightful fictional studies of a woman's consciousness in English literature.Arguably Bronte&#39;s most refined and deeply felt work, Villette draws on her experiences as a student in Brussels as well as her profound loneliness following the deaths of her three siblings. Lucy Snowe, the narrator of Villette, flees from an unhappy past in England to begin a new life as a teacher at a French boarding school in the great cosmopolitan capital of Villette. Soon Lucy&#39;s struggle for independence is overshadowed by both her friendship with a worldly English doctor and her feelings for an autocratic schoolmaster.

Designed primarily for those who have not had a previous course in religion, it provides the student with an understanding of what religion is, of the universal forms of religious experience, and of the basic concepts that make up a religious worldview. By employing a comparative analysis across a rich range of ancient and modern religious traditions, this introduction allows students to see the ways in which certain classic forms of religious life appear in different societies over time, as well as to recognize the incredible diversity of human religious expression and belief. </p> <p> The book is divided into three parts. Part I is concerned with such questions as the problem of defining religion, why it is important to study religion, and how one goes about the task, including the several disciplines or methods used in the study of religion. Each method is illustrated with specific examples from the work of eminent scholars in the field, such as Rudolf Otto, Carl Jung, Edward Evans-Pritchard, Victor Turner, Mircea Eliade, and Clifford Geertz. </p> <p> Part II is an introduction to the universal forms of religious experience and expression and includes discussions of the sacred and holy; religious symbolism, myth, and doctrine; sacred ritual; sacred scripture; and the social dimensions of religion. Each chapter includes an analysis of influential scholarship on the subject, and each topic is fully illustrated with, for instance, examples of the variety of forms of religious ritual and types of religious community. </p> <p> Part III, which constitutes more than half of the book, consists of a comparative analysis of seven concepts, each one representing a fundamental structure or component of a religious worldview. A religious worldview is holistic, that is, it sees nature, human life, and the divine as interrelated and as forming a comprehensive vision of the world. A religion, therefore, includes a conception of sacred power and of an exemplary natural and social order. It offers an analysis of the breakdown or corruption of that order and of the human problem, but it also provides an answer to the ever-present threat of evil and chaos. Finally, a religious worldview affords an ethical pattern of action, a way of achieving liberation or enlightenment, and an ideal vision of the goal or end of human life. Part III thus includes analyses of such concepts as deity, cosmogony, the human problem, theodicy, ethics, the ways to salvation or liberation, and the end or goal of salvation. Again, each theme is illustrated by examples drawn from a wide variety of religious belief and behavior, ranging from primal and archaic cultures through the religions of the present. </p> <p> Each chapter of the book includes a preliminary overview which gives the student a clear preview of the major themes that follow. Each chapter also includes photographs, notes, key words, review questions, and suggestions for further reading. An extensive glossary provides a ready explanation of important terms and names used in the book. </p> <p> Preparing a fourth edition of this book has afforded me the opportunity to undertake some significant revisions, some of which were suggested by teachers who use this text in the classroom. Previous new editions added substantial new material, including whole new chapters, illustrative material, and photographs, increasing substantially the size of the book. In this edition I have attempted to shorten and simplify some discussions and to remove some material to achieve a chapter organization and length that will be in accord with many semester schedules without, however, sacrificing the text's comprehensive and varied coverage. </p> <p> This fourth edition has also undergone a considerable revision of the teaching aids that accompany each chapter. At the request of several teachers, I have added carefully selected <i>key words</i> for each chapter. I hope this will be helpful to students in sorting out those crucial terms, names, and concepts from those that may, necessarily, be used to relate a myth or to describe a religious phenomenon, but that are not essential to comprehend the concepts of religious beliefs and practices that are key to the purposes of a particular chapter. I remain convinced, nonetheless, that an important goal of a text such as this is to introduce students to the vocabulary of religion&#x2014;the important terms, concepts, and proper names critical to an educated understanding of the phenomenon of religion and to some of the great religious traditions. I hope that the <i>key words</i> and the expanded <i>glossary</i> will aid in the reader's achievement of this goal. The <i>review questions</i> have also been given careful scrutiny and have, in several cases, been revised. More attention is also given to the overall plan of the book and to how the various chapters may relate and contribute to the whole. Finally, the <i>suggestions for further reading</i> have been updated to include valuable new sources, although many of the classics relevant to a particular subject are retained since they remain just that, standard works. </p> <p> In preparing a new edition of a book of this scope, I am especially aware of my debt to other scholars and especially to those teachers who were asked to evaluate the third edition and for their advice in the preparation of this one. I am particularly grateful to three persons who assisted me in this revision. As the Visiting Walter G. Mason Professor at the College of William &amp; Mary, Willard G. Oxtoby used this text in his introduction to religion class. He was very generous in spending substantial time with me discussing possible changes and improvements while he was working on a revision of a book of his own. Will's suggestions ranged from small but important details to larger questions of selection and interpretation. I was able to incorporate mast of his proposals. </p> <p> Hal Breitenberg, a former student who now teaches at Randolph-Macon College, has used <i>Anatomy of the Sacred</i> in the classroom and has given me much wise counsel on revisions. He was particularly helpful regarding the inclusion of key words and with improving the review questions. With his permission, I have incorporated many of his specific suggestions, and on these matters I consider him a genuine collaborator. </p> <p> Elizabeth Williams, a student assistant in the Department of Religion at the College of William &amp; Mary, incorporated all of the editorial changes for this edition onto the master copy, for which I am most grateful. Finally, I am much indebted to my production editor, Edie Riker, and to the copy editor, Martha Williams, for their excellent work. </p> <p> <i>J. C. L</i> </p><p> "Three strengths (of the text are): 1) The global perspective, incorporating examples from many world religions and setting them side by side to consider in relation to one another without making any judgments; 2) The clear, comprehensive, beautifully written prose in the areas of summary and general commentary on religions and religious phenomena; 3) The introductory material with a fascinating and thorough coverage of various definitions of religions, perspectives on religion, and ways of studying religion. This material is extremely helpful." &#x2014; Linda J. Tessier, <i>Youngstown State University</i> </p> <p> "...It (Anatomy of the Sacred) is the best text in the field." &#x2014; Steven W. Godby, <i>Broward Community College</i> </p> <p> "It (Anatomy of the Sacred) covers some of the basic theories of religion and then illustrates these theories by delineating various themes in the global history (phenomenology) of religion. This is a very helpful way to construct an introductory textbook... I am impressed by Professor Livingston's erudition ...Livingston is respectful of all Religions." &#x2014; Winston Davis, <i>Washington and Lee University</i> </p></p><h2>Africa in World History</h2><p><p> </p> <b> <p>Provides a view of African history in the wider context of world history. </p> </b><p><b> </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p> <i>Africa in World History </i>is the first comprehensive survey to illustrate how Africans have influenced regions beyond their continent&#x2019;s borders, how they have been influenced from the outside and how internal African developments can be compared to those elsewhere in the world.

Many of us&#x2014;patients and doctors included&#x2014;do not realize that changes in our daily choices and habits can improve quality of life, increase the chances of survival, and aid in the healing process for those with a diagnosis. These ideas were pioneered in David Servan-Schreiber&#x2019;s <i>Anticancer: A New Way of Life</i>, and became the basis for a research study developed by Lorenzo Cohen and Servan-Schreiber at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.<br> &nbsp;<br> Introducing the concept of the &#x201c;Mix of Six,&#x201d; Cohen and Alison Jefferies make an informed case that building social and emotional support; manag�ing stress; improving sleep, exercise, and diet; and minimizing exposure to environmental toxins work together to promote an optimal environment for health and well-being. While each plays an inde�pendent role, the synergy created by all six factors can radically transform health; delay or prevent many cancers; support conventional treatments; and significantly improve quality of life&#x2014;as many testi�monies and stories of those in the anticancer com�munity eloquently show. <br><br> <i>Anticancer Living</i> provides an accessible, pre�scriptive guide to wellness based on the latest scien�tific findings and clinical trials, and it showcases the community of doctors, researchers, caregivers, and patients who have been inspired to create change.</p><p><b>Lorenzo Cohen, PhD</b>, is the Richard E.

As more research has emerged showing a clear link between our mental and physical state and lifestyle factors and our ability to avoid and survive cancer and other diseases, even the more skeptical within the medical community have begun to take notice. Over the years, more times than I can count, cancer doctors across all disciplines have confided in me that they have long suspected that their patients' mental state and lifestyle plays an important role in their ability to survive a cancer diagnosis and restore themselves to wellness. What is becoming increasingly evident based on solid science and our improved ability to measure and document the biological effects of lifestyle changes is this: comprehensive lifestyle change, combined with conventional cancer care, is powerful medicine that can help control, and potentially prevent, cancer.<br><br>Living with Cancer<br><br>Once, a cancer diagnosis was basically a death sentence. Although it could, with a lot of medical might, be beaten back, it would rarely be defeated. Over the past couple of decades, however, this has begun to change. Cancer is now, for many, considered a serious, chronic disease. What this means in practical terms is that more people are living longer with cancer. And this is very good news. But survival raises new questions: Are these people who are living longer with cancer better feeling!-healthy and well-even if they are not cured?<br><br>Some oncologists might wonder why, if the patient is surviving, this question is relevant at all. In my area of expertise, the world of integrative medicine, this question is everything. I spend my workdays helping cancer patients make choices so that they will feel healthy-even as they undergo difficult, sometimes debilitating, treatments-because it's precisely these lifestyle changes that will also increase their odds of survival. And while I focus on their quality of life, my colleagues continue to better understand how cancer cells work, guiding the move from a one-size-fits-all approach to more nuanced, personal treatment. Much of this shift from a "hit it hard and fast" mind-set to more of what is being called "precision medicine" is due to the relatively recent breakthroughs we've made in understanding how our genes and cells work. We're also developing and harnessing technologies that allow us to detect many cancers earlier-and the earlier a cancer is found, the better the prognosis and treatment outcome.<br><br>These innovations are incredibly important, and alongside these advancements are exciting discoveries being made not by scientists in labs or surgeons in operating room suites but by regular people in their kitchens and homes; on jogging trails; and in grocery stores, yoga studios, gyms, and wellness centers. Everyday lifestyle choices give us a surprising amount of control and influence over the trajectory of a cancer diagnosis and of our cancer risk. By making simple changes to the way we live, we can diminish the side effects of conventional cancer treatments, extend (and sometimes shatter) expected survival rates, decrease the chance for recurrence of disease, and potentially prevent the onset of cancer diseases in the first place. It's an exciting time to be in the realm of integrative care, but it took us a very long time to reach this point, and it's taking even longer to get the word out that lifestyle change is legitimate, effective medicine to help prevent and control cancer.<br><br>Are the Odds Really Stacked Against Us?<br><br>During the last fifty years, tremendous advances have been made in frontline treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. These treatments, along with the innovative developments in targeted therapies (aimed at the abnormal proteins controlling cancer growth) and immunotherapy, have saved or prolonged the lives of millions of people. In fact, our success rate at keeping people alive after a cancer diagnosis is better than ever.<br><br>Yet despite these medical advances, nearly 1.7 million Americans are projected to receive a cancer diagnosis in 2017. During that same twelve-month period, cancer will claim the lives of more than six hundred thousand people in the United States. Around the world, cancer remains a leading cause of death, and new cases are expected to increase by 70 percent in the next two decades. In 2015, the disease took the lives of 8.8 million people globally.<br><br>Based on current models, one-third of all American women and half of all American men will receive a cancer diagnosis in their lifetimes. Worldwide, nearly one out of every six deaths is due to cancer. This means that the odds are extremely high that both you and I will one day join the more than 15.5 million Americans who are currently living with cancer and the tens of millions of cancer survivors around the world.<br><br>Given these staggering numbers, it's unlikely that we'll eliminate cancer anytime soon, though this will not stop us from trying. Also unlikely is the discovery of one drug or treatment-a magic bullet-that will eradicate this increasingly complex range of diseases. What is more likely-as we are beginning to see now-is that we'll continue to understand how cancer cells respond to various stimuli and learn to slow or "turn off" their progression. Similarly, we hope to better understand the processes that trigger cancer's growth and target them with effective treatment. We're already seeing compelling evidence that lifestyle factors may be the missing ingredient of the existing cancer treatment model.<br><br>Cancer, first and foremost, is a disease of aging: our odds of getting most cancers rises significantly each decade we live past the age of fifty. This puts us in a bit of quandary, since we are-thanks in no small part to modern medicine-living longer and longer lives. The onset of diseases such as cancer adds a terrible burden to the already great challenges of aging, as our cells become more vulnerable to damage and corruption.<br><br>Although most cancers strike when we're older, there are some types (including colorectal and breast cancers) that are striking people at increasingly younger ages, and these cancers are often quite aggressive and fiercely resistant to treatment. In fact, recent data suggest that younger people are not only being diagnosed with colon cancer more than ever before but also dying of the disease in higher and higher numbers. Some childhood cancers are also on the rise.<br><br>So far, the medical establishment's response to the uptick appearing in the young has been to call for earlier screening, which is, of course, a prudent place to start. But early detection, we've found, isn't always the best or only answer. There are instances of early detection with some cancers, such as early-stage, low-grade prostate cancer and very-early-stage breast cancer, that lead to overtreatment with no demonstrable survival benefits. In fact, the current recommendations have changed from "all men over fifty need to be screened to prostate cancer" to "all men over fifty should have a conversation with their physician about prostate screening." Could there, then, be a better way to prevent or delay the onset of cancers, including the aggressive types that seem to strike people so young? I believe the answer is yes.<br><br>Current cancer statistics can be sobering, even frightening, but the larger picture offers good news. There has been a positive, almost radical shift in cancer survival rates. Fifty years ago, only one in four Americans survived cancer for more than a decade; today that ratio is one in two-a doubling in overall survival rates. Is this because treatments and technologies have improved? In part, yes. Absolutely. But now we're beginning to understand that medical advances are not the only reason for improved outcomes.<br><br>Still, it is the unpredictable nature of cancer that often makes us feel powerless. Despite all we know of the disease and all the money that has gone into research and treatment, cancer has a way of defying our expectations and striking those who seem least likely candidates for a diagnosis. There is the singer who never smoked a day in her life who is diagnosed with lung cancer. Or the vegan runner who has been lean and fit his whole life and prides himself on his "clean" diet, only to be diagnosed young with stage IV colon cancer. And, most cruelly, there is the very young child who must battle an aggressive form of leukemia before she even has the words to describe what it all feels like. Why is it, we can't help but wonder, that my body, anybody's body, would let this happen? What could trigger such an awful disease within us?<br><br>It is perfectly normal to run the gauntlet of these thoughts and feelings and ask ourselves all these questions, but it is even more important that we don't beat ourselves up or blame or shame ourselves into resignation or passivity. Meg Hirshberg is a friend, breast cancer survivor, and the founder of the Anticancer Lifestyle Program, a nonprofit, evidence-based lifestyle program for people diagnosed with cancer. She recently spoke to me about why it's so important to resist blaming yourself if you get cancer: "Our message is always, 'Begin now. Don't look back. We have no idea what caused your cancer and we never will. But we do know that there are things you can do differently that will make a radical difference in how you feel. There is also scientific evidence that shows how these lifestyle changes will positively influence the results of your treatment.'" For Meg and the people who go through her program, this forward focus is accompanied by active education about the healing power of making lifestyle changes and the healing benefits of a loving community. As she continues, "Knowledge is power and, where cancer is concerned, knowledge has the power to enable survivors to lower the odds of cancer recurrence. There is data to back this up and we want to share that science with our community in ways that make people feel more hopeful, more powerful, more inspired, and more alive."</p><h2>Tiger&#39;s Destiny (Book 4 in the Tiger&#39;s Curse Series)</h2><p>With three of the goddess Durga's quests behind them, only one prophecy now stands in the way of Kelsey, Ren, and Kishan breaking the tiger's curse.

After more than a decade covering a variety of conflicts in the Middle East and Asia, he was now appearing nightly on network television. Just when it seemed that he had attained everything he had ever aspired to and spent his life working for, Dean's life as he knew it came to a devastating end. He had experienced various levels of excruciating pain for the past six years after suffering a fractured vertebra and declining surgery. But now he knew that something was terribly wrong. Rushed into emergency surgery, he woke from general anesthesia to a doctor standing over him, giving him the grave news that the operation had "failed" and that Dean would be "permanently disabled."<br><br>Unable to sit, barely able to walk, Dean returned to the States, literally and figuratively a broken man, his spirit as broken as his spine, his career over. Within months, he was little more than what he described as a man "pickled on painkillers."<br><br>Over the next couple of years, little changed-until his wife gave birth to their first child. His time celebrating Finn's birth was cut short, however. Dean's health, which had been deteriorating since the failed surgery, had taken a turn for the worse. Tests revealed a new, life-altering diagnosis: cancer. His prognosis was "a year or two to live." With his physical pain and mental torment more severe than ever, Dean's doses of prescription painkillers were increased and now included a morphine drip.<br><br>Months passed with Dean bedridden and in all but a hopeless state. Then, with less than a year to live, Dean had an epiphany. Lying in bed with his young son playing nearby, the nightmare of the past few years and the weight of dying suddenly came crushing down on him. He was overwhelmed by the realization that he was moving irreversibly toward fulfilling the doctors' prognosis; he and his son-the most precious thing in the world to him-would soon be separated forever.<br><br>Suddenly, as though breaking through the dark cloud that had been overshadowing his whole life the past few years, Dean saw himself through the eyes of his son. If nothing changed and he was to die, Finn's only memory of his father would be that of a man who had committed to nothing other than being a helpless victim. Dean realized that he had so succumbed to self-pity that his son had never seen his father do or be anything that Finn could look back on and be proud of. It was not Dean's fault that he broke his back or had cancer, but Finn had not seen him even try to make the best of the time he did have- that was Dean's responsibility. Someone somewhere in the world had it worse than he did, Dean realized, and someone somewhere was doing better than he was with far less.<br><br>Dean immediately made a resolution. He would change. There was no way to know if he would survive cancer or ever be an able-bodied father who could play baseball with his son, but he made a commitment nonetheless. For however many days he had left, he would be a living example to his son of how a man could, or in Dean's eyes should, live his life. He would face the circumstances in his life exactly as he would want Finn to face his own future challenges.<br><br>A few days later, Dean found himself doing yoga for the first time in a class that was being offered at his rehabilitation center. Within minutes, he knew he had, in his words, "found his path to healing." He had no way of knowing whether the healing would be spiritual and physical or just spiritual, but he sensed that it was the beginning of a new chapter in his life.<br><br>Driven by his resolve, Dean immersed himself in learning everything he could about well-being, spirituality, and cancer therapies and applying what he learned. He consumed books on diet and nutrition, yoga, spirituality, positive thinking, visualization, and meditation. He dramatically changed his lifestyle, inside and out. He willed himself to practice yoga and meditation for hours a day-in the beginning, crawling out of bed to get onto his yoga mat.<br><br>As the months passed, things began to change. Dean could sit up for ten, then twenty, then eventually sixty minutes at a time. Soon after that, he was able to walk to the kitchen. He cut back on his pain medication and eventually stopped it altogether. More victories came. Eventually he was able to drive. And then came the one change that meant more to him than any of the others: he was able to lift and hold his son. Miraculously, and to his doctors' amazement, Dean had healed his broken back. But his transformation didn't end there. A short time later, about the time he was supposed to be dead, Dean received a new diagnosis: he was "cancer-free."<br><br>Dean's story is extraordinary. A person can do all that he did (and more) and still not be cured of cancer or heal a broken back, but his is more than a story about beating the odds. It is an illustration of the power of desire coupled with the willingness to use every resource available to achieve a goal. It is a telling reminder of just how potent you can be in affecting your destiny. Viewed from a different perspective, Dean's story can also be seen as ordinary, in the sense that it portrays the very definition of what constitutes a human being, what in Sanskrit is called a kama yoni, which means "the species which has the privilege of performing actions and which thus can change the course of its destiny." By seizing his resolve and taking positive command of all the resources available to him, Dean was embodying the principle that defines us and sets us apart from all other species.<br><br>This idea was eloquently expressed by French essayist Charles Du Bos, who I believe conveyed the essence of all yogic teachings as well as the formula for achieving a truly fulfilled life when he wrote, "The important thing is this: to be able, at any moment, to sacrifice what we are for what we could become."<br><br>Take a moment to consider who you would be and how much better our world would be if more of us would "sacrifice what we are for what we could become."<br><br>Dean came to one of my Yoga of Fulfillment workshops after he had healed physically. Wanting a clearer understanding of what had transformed him, he was hoping to make use of the same power to overcome the current challenges in his life. Working with the processes of the Yoga of Fulfillment allowed Dean to see that having to face the prospect of imminent death, of being permanently separated from his son, had been the catalyst he needed to be willing to change his life. His intention to be "a living example" to his son for whatever time he had left altered the course of his destiny.<br><br>Dean's miracle-like accomplishments had everything to do with his willingness to sacrifice what he was in order to become what he could be. It began by him acknowledging his desire and finding a specific goal that he knew deep in his heart was absolutely worth achieving. Dean's overriding desire was to give his son a father he could love, respect, and perhaps even one day emulate. The Yoga of Fulfillment helped him realize that he had intuitively applied the principles that the ancient tradition teaches are key to achieving our goals. Once he learned the principles, he was able to apply them systematically to successfully meet the new challenges in his life.<br><br>Dean's intuitive unearthing of a singular and compelling purpose for his life combined with his all-consuming commitment to fulfilling it is a powerful illustration of a profound truth that was something of a credo for my first teacher, Mani. Drawing from an ancient scripture, he would constantly repeat, "A person can achieve almost anything, can surmount any difficulties, if they can harness their power."<br><br>The good news is that you don't need to be facing life-and-death circumstances, as Dean was, to harness this power. As Mani reminded me time and time again, you have extraordinary power to accomplish extraordinary things-enough to "achieve almost anything" and "surmount any difficulties"-if you are willing to formulate goals and learn how to direct your innate power toward achieving them. The foundation for achieving any and all that you aspire to is the power of desire.<br><br>Desire Is Everything and Everywhere<br><br>Desire touches everything in the natural world. It is easy to lose sight of just how powerful, pervasive, and integral desire is to the world in which you and I live. If not for a spark between your biological father's sperm and biological mother's egg, you wouldn't exist. Thanks to one particularly desirous sperm, you are in your present form, reading these words. Congratulations. You are, in fact, the winner of an intense competition between millions of other microscopic sperm desirous of impregnating an egg.<br><br>At your birth, more than your mother's desire was necessary to bring you into the world. If you were born naturally, you actively engaged in a most intense sequence of what are unmistakably willful and desirous contortions to pass through your mother's birth canal. And just in case the sum of your and your mother's desires had not been enough to bring you into the world safely, it would have been necessary to rely on the desire of doctors and other caregivers to intervene. "Man is verily formed of desire," the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad reminds us.<br><br>Desire's role didn't end when you came into the world. Desire compelled you to lift your head and then to roll over and later to stand; once you were able to stand, desire compelled you to walk, then to run. Thanks to desire, you sought to develop the skill of language, in large part so you could more clearly ask for-if not insist on-the things you wanted as well as to participate with those around you. Speaking, and later writing, provided you more freedom and capacity to pursue your desires in life. You are who and what you are because of desire.<br><br>God of the Old Testament had desires. His desires were the first sparks that created light and life, day and night, heaven and earth, and the stars. Before any of them existed, according to the Judeo- Christian tradition, each was a flicker of desire in the eye of the Almighty. The same concept is found in the spiritual traditions of India. The Yajur Veda, for example, one of the four original Vedic texts, tells us that divine desire, or kama, created the world. Without this desire, the world could not exist.<br><br>The Vedas teach that desire is ever-present. It is with you at every step and with every breath you take. Desire precedes your every action, since before you can do, you first have to want. I can't lift my arm, reach for a drink of water, or do anything else without first wanting to; thus every action you have done or will do-including those that are sparked by your subconscious-is preceded by a desire.<br><br>Desire is also the seed of every thought. The tradition teaches that before you can have a thought, you first have to have a desire. Imagine how many thoughts you have had in your lifetime and you'll begin to have an idea how many desires you have had.<br><br>"As long as one has a body, one cannot renounce action altogether," says the Bhagavad Gita. Thus, for all practical purposes, as long as you are acting, thinking, or speaking-as long as you are alive-there is no end to desire.<br><br>Desire, the same thing that possessed the part of you that at one time was the sperm to fertilize the other part of you that was the egg, is the same thing that compels your lungs to breathe, your heart to beat, your kidneys to function, your body, in all its complexity, to work as an integrated whole. This same spark also fuels your desire for spiritual and lasting fulfillment and motivates you to seek fulfillment in every facet of life.<br><br>To paraphrase T. K. V. Desikachar, a renowned author and widely considered a leading voice for the ancient tradition of yoga, the first step in yoga is the desire to be better. Alain Dani�lou, a highly respected authority on Vedic wisdom, in his book Virtue, Success, Pleasure, and Liberation, cites Madhavacharya: "On the physical, as on the intellectual and spiritual plane, all creation, all invention, all imagination is the fruit of desire."<br><br>Even the Buddha, who, it is fair to say, transcended desire, preached what he called the Middle Way or Middle Path, which is the path, according to the Buddha, that led to the state of enlightenment. He described it as the balance between the extremes of sensual indulgence and total renunciation. It is also worth noting that a deep and profound aspiration was what moved the Buddha to pursue and eventually achieve enlightenment. In other words, without a highly evolved desire to overcome suffering and the pain of impermanence, he would not have achieved sublime exaltation; he would not have been moved to search for a way to end his own suffering and then, after he achieved it, to alleviate it in those he saw around him.<br><br>Desire is here to stay. The challenge we all face, and which I intend to guide you through, is to learn how to take into account the full measure of who you are and use the positive force of all four of your soul's desires-dharma, the desire to become who you were meant to be; artha, the desire for the means to help you fulfill your dharma; kama, the desire for pleasure of all kinds; and moksha, the desire for freedom and a connection to the Eternal-to lead you to your best life.<br><br>chapter 2<br><br>Two Kinds of Fulfillment<br><br>The Oxford American Dictionary defines fulfillment as "satisfaction or happiness as a result of fully developing one's abilities or character," and as "the achievement of something desired, promised, or predicted." It's worth noting that both aspects of this definition are attainment-oriented, something you feel whenever you satisfy a want or desire, or reach a goal.<br><br>You first experienced this kind of fulfillment early in life when, for example, you were provided with milk in response to your cries. This kind of fulfillment continued, evolving into the elation you probably felt on Christmas morning if the presents you hoped for were under the tree, the pride of receiving the merit badge you aspired to as a Boy or Girl Scout, the pleasure of buying something you really wanted, the excitement of your first kiss or your first sexual experience, the high of a promotion at work, the thrill of your stocks going up, the joy of discovering that someone you are attracted to feels the same way about you. The more you've desired something, the longer you've waited for it, the more of this kind of fulfillment you are likely to experience when it's finally yours.

She earned her MFA in Writing for Children and Young Adults at the Vermont College of Fine Arts. <i>Circus Mirandus </i>is her first novel.<b>Chapter 4<br>Impossible Letters</b><br><br>Grandpa Ephraim opened the drawer of his bedside table to reveal balls of crumpled paper. Micah uncrumpled them one by one until the bed was covered with letters, letters made up of impossible words.<br><br><i>Lightbender</i>, the letters said.<br><i>Circus Mirandus</i>, they said.<br><br>And they said one more thing, one very crucial thing. <i>You promised me a miracle</i>.<br><br>Micah knew about the promise the Lightbender had made to his grandfather. It came at the very end of the story, and it was one of Micah&#x2019;s favorite parts. But . . . it was only a story.<br><br>His grandfather placed his hand on top of one of the crinkled sheets of paper. &#x201c;It took me quite a few drafts to get it right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand,&#x201d; said Micah. &#x201c;Circus Mirandus isn&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Real?&#x201d; Grandpa Ephraim said quietly. &#x201c;But it is.&#x201d;<br><br>A smile was tugging up every wrinkle of Grandpa Ephraim&#x2019;s face. It wasn&#x2019;t a teasing smile.<br><br>Micah stared at all of the letters spread across the crocheted blanket. &#x201c;If it&#x2019;s really true ...&#x201d;<br><br>Grandpa Ephraim laughed his <i>blub glub</i> laugh and beckoned with one arm. When Micah reached for him, he pulled him close in a weak hug and wheezed in his ear, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the truest thing ever. I&#x2019;m so sorry I never told you.&#x201d;<br><br>Micah hadn&#x2019;t realized there was a fist in his chest until his grandfather&#x2019;s words made it unclench. Grandpa Ephraim would never lie about something so important. And that meant . . . that meant magic was real. And, more importantly, a real magician had made a promise to his grandfather. Micah wouldn&#x2019;t have to be alone. The Lightbender could save Grandpa Ephraim. The world would go back to being the way it was supposed to be.<br><br>Micah hugged his grandfather so tightly that his arms hurt. &#x201c;Everything&#x2019;s going to be all right,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It is.&#x201d;<br><br>Grandpa Ephraim lay back on his pillows and nodded. &#x201c;I think it might. I finished the final draft of the letter last night, and a messenger came for it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It was the most astonishing thing. I wish you could have been here to see it. I had no idea how to get the letter to the circus, but the messenger flew in through the window a few hours after I had finished writing it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wait. Did you say flew?&#x201d;<br><br>Grandpa Ephraim&#x2019;s grin widened. &#x201c;Yes. It does sound strange, doesn&#x2019;t it? Apparently the Lightbender uses a parrot for his mail. She said she preferred to take phone calls, actually, but I&#x2019;m really not sure how that would work. I should have expected something fantastic.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Phone calls?&#x201d; Micah rubbed at the back of his neck with one hand. &#x201c;This . . . it&#x2019;s so . . . wow!&#x201d;<br><br>He looked around the bedroom and realized that everything had been transformed. This wasn&#x2019;t a room where Grandpa Ephraim had been sick; it was a room where he was going to get well again. Even the afternoon sunbeams that shone through the window seemed brighter.<br><br>&#x201c;And this mail parrot&#x2014;she was going to give the Lightbender your message? She was going to tell him to come here?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Grandpa Ephraim said. He bent over and coughed a couple of times. Micah started to pass him a tissue from the box on the bedside table, but he waved it away. &#x201c;I hope,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;that he&#x2019;ll agree to help us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He has to.&#x201d; If this was real&#x2014;and it just had to be&#x2014;then the Lightbender would help them. Micah didn&#x2019;t see how he could refuse. In Grandpa Ephraim&#x2019;s story he was a very powerful magician, a good magician, and he had promised.<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait for you to meet him.&#x201d; Grandpa Ephraim coughed again. &#x201c;The messenger said Circus Mirandus was in La Paz right now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s in Bolivia. So I&#x2019;m not sure how&#x2014;&#x201d; <i>Blub glub</i>.<br><br>Micah handed him a tissue, and this time he coughed into it.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you think it will take long?&#x201d; Micah asked. &#x201c;For the Lightbender to fix you, I mean.&#x201d;<br><br>Aunt Gertrudis would have to move out of the spare bedroom to make room for their guest, he decided. She would be glad to be going back to Arizona without Micah anyway. She&#x2019;d been saying just the other day how difficult it would be to find room for him in her apartment.<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Grandpa Ephraim was coughing so hard that he barely got the word out.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you okay?&#x201d;<br><br><i>Blub glub</i>. &#x201c;I think I need . . .&#x201d; Grandpa Ephraim&#x2019;s face was turning pale. His eyes were clenched shut. His mouth was opening and closing like a fish&#x2019;s, and all of his words had turned into nothing but <i>blub glub, blub glub</i>.<br><br>Micah was on his feet in an instant. &#x201c;Grandpa? What should I do?&#x201d;<br><br>That awful, dying-kettle sound was lasting for much too long. He was about to ask if he should fetch a cup of water, or the breathing machine that the doctor had given them, but hands were on his shoulders, jerking him away.<br><br>Aunt Gertrudis&#x2019;s nostrils flared. &#x201c;Out!&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Get out. Getting him excited for no good reason.&#x201d;<br><br>Her eyes landed on the letters spread out on the bed. They narrowed into slits.<br><br>&#x201c;This again,&#x201d; she hissed. &#x201c;I should have known.&#x201d;<br><br>Micah didn&#x2019;t know what possessed him in that moment, but it was something with a lot of bravery and almost no good sense. Instead of leaving, he ducked around his aunt and made a wild grab for the letters.<br><br>He managed to snag one of them before Aunt Gertrudis caught him by the back of his T-shirt. &#x201c;I said <i>out</i>!&#x201d; she shouted. &#x201c;Go to your room!&#x201d;<br><br>She snatched at the letter in his hand as she shoved him toward the door. Micah&#x2019;s fist was closed too tightly around the paper, though. It ripped, and he stumbled out into the hall, nearly colliding with the wall. The door slammed behind him, and the lock clicked.<br><br>&#x201c;Grandpa Ephraim!&#x201d; he yelled. &#x201c;Are you all right? Aunt Gertrudis? Please let me in!&#x201d;<br><br>Nobody answered.<br><br>Micah slid down the wall and sat, staring at the door, wishing that it would burst into a thousand splinters. The silence from the other side seemed to last forever before he heard the breathing machine turn on. The grinding sound of it made him feel like he might never be able to move from that spot again.<br><br>The half of the letter that he had managed to rescue from Grandpa Ephraim&#x2019;s room trembled in his hands. Micah pressed the creases out as best he could, running his fingers across the words over and over again until the paper began to feel soft.<br><br><i>You have to get up</i>, he told himself.<br><br>He had to be ready to meet the Lightbender when he came. He had to make sure that Grandpa Ephraim got his miracle before it was too late.<br><b>Chapter 5<br>The Messenger</b><br><br>The messenger&#x2019;s name was Chintzy, and she returned to Circus Mirandus just before the sun set on a dreary afternoon. She ignored the excited <i>oohs </i>and <i>aahs </i>of the children who spotted her as she zipped toward the black-and-gold tent she called home.<br><br>&#x201c;All this rain!&#x201d; she squawked once she was safely atop her perch. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know why the Head allows it. Gray, cold, <i>wet</i>. Ruins the mood of the place.&#x201d;<br><br>She ruffled her damp red feathers and glared with one beady yellow eye at the Man Who Bends Light, who was fiddling with an ornate silver coffee service beside her perch. He looked as he had for centuries. His sandy hair was a tangled nest, and his beaten, brown leather coat swept the ground. His nose was strong&#x2014;almost, Chintzy had been known to admit from time to time, like a proper beak.<br><br>&#x201c;The meadow around the circus needs rain as much as any other living thing,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re just in a snit because you wasted your day on a fool&#x2019;s errand. Not every twitch of your tail is a magical event. I told you I wasn&#x2019;t expecting any messages.&#x201d;<br><br>Chintzy snatched a lemon cookie off the coffee tray with one clawed foot. &#x201c;Shows what you know,&#x201d; she muttered around a beakful of crumbs.<br><br>&#x201c;I told you,&#x201d; he said again, then paused. &#x201c;Wait. There was a message?&#x201d;<br><br>She shook her tail feathers at him. &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t be insulting my tail twitches anymore, will you?&#x201d; she said smugly. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t have gone if there wasn&#x2019;t a message. Flying all that way. My poor wings!&#x201d;<br><br>The tray rattled as he plunked the creamer onto it. &#x201c;Who could possibly . . .?&#x201d; He looked sharply at her. &#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t Victoria. Was it?&#x201d;<br><br>Chintzy honk-snorted at him. It was her favorite rude sound. &#x201c;Of course not! After all these years? Not that I would deliver a message for <i>her </i>anyway. Not after what she did.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I suppose that is for the best. Who sent the message?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You suppose right. Can you imagine what the Head would say?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The message, Chintzy,&#x201d; he reminded her.<br><br>&#x201c;I almost perished of fatigue, you know.&#x201d; She drooped on her perch in an attempt to look terribly forlorn and&nbsp;dramatic. &#x201c;You could have lost me.&#x201d;<br><br>He rolled his eyes. &#x201c;I am rarely so lucky.&#x201d;<br><br>Chintzy shrieked.<br><br>&#x201c;Do not <i>swear </i>at me. I know for a fact that Porter opened a Door for you last night. It&#x2019;s not as though you had to flap all the way there.&#x201d;<br><br>She turned her back on him. &#x201c;Ingrate.&#x201d;<br><br>He sighed. &#x201c;I know. I am sorry, Chintzy. I do appreciate your hard work. Would you please give me the message?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, if you&#x2019;re going to beg . . .&#x201d; She spun around and puffed out her scarlet chest. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a professional, you know. The letter disintegrated in this rain you insist upon defending, but I memorized it for safekeeping.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Very impressive.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am,&#x201d; she agreed. &#x201c;The message is from a child who saw your show.&#x201d;<br><br>Then she paused and tilted her head. &#x201c;Well, no, that&#x2019;s not exactly right. He&#x2019;s not a child anymore. He grew up.&#x201d;<br><br>The Man Who Bends Light furrowed his brow. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s from an adult?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He almost shocked the eggs out of me,&#x201d; Chintzy&nbsp;admitted. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s that serious. You&#x2019;re going to be in such trouble with the Head, and . . . well, I guess I&#x2019;ll let you hear it.&#x201d; She cleared her throat to acknowledge the formality of the situation, and then she recited Ephraim&#x2019;s letter.<br><br>After she finished, the tent was silent for a long time. The Man Who Bends Light stood as still as a petrified stump. As the minutes dragged by, the quiet started to itch. Chintzy plucked a couple of particularly beautiful chest feathers before she even realized how nervous she was.<br><br>She cleared her throat again. &#x201c;He shortened your name, such as it is. <i>Lightbender</i>. Clever. Much more modern.&#x201d;<br><br>When he didn&#x2019;t respond, she bobbed her head and added,&nbsp;&#x201c;He called me <i>ma&#x2019;am</i>, too. You should take notes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;As if your ego needed stroking.&#x201d; He folded his legs and sank onto a tasseled floor cushion. &#x201c;Ephraim Tuttle,&#x201d; he murmured. &#x201c;That is something I didn&#x2019;t expect.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who is he? Looked about as special as a goose on a pond, if you ask me. Not the sort we usually deal with.&#x201d;<br><br>The Man Who Bends Light looked thoughtful. &#x201c;He is a child who was called to Circus Mirandus. Or he was. And he was special, compared to most.&#x201d; He stared down at his long fingers, and a smile crept across his lips. &#x201c;He showed me a magic trick.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A real one?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Quite.&#x201d; He glanced at her. &#x201c;Do you know what Ephraim wants for his miracle?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure. He wants to talk to you. Maybe . . .&#x201d; Chintzy refused to look at him.<br><br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s very old,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And he&#x2019;s dying, I think.&#x201d;<br><br>The Man Who Bends Light flinched. &#x201c;Dying?

He proposes that multiple sclerosis, lupus, leukemia, chronic fatigue syndrome, Parkinson's disease, many mental disorders including Alzheimer's, and even major diseases like breast cancer are caused, in part, by the toxins we place in our bodies. Where do these toxins come from and how do they get into our bodies? You my be surprised to find that you have actually paid to have them put there. These dangerous materials--mercury, cadmium, beryllium, nickel, and others--are used in <i>everyday dentistry</i> to make up the fillings, root canals, and bridgework in our mouths, and are supposed to be "safe." But are they?</p><p></p><i>Uninformed Consent</i> presents cases of toxic poisoning--of depressed immune systems and inexplicable illnesses--to toxins entering the bloodstream from the heavy metals in dental materials. The authors also discuss the hidden truths that the dental industry in America doesn't want to talk about, and the real reasons the dangers of these materials have been suppressed and ignored. <p></p>Drs. Huggins and Levy implore the reader: "Don't leave your health in your dentist's hands and assume that all will be fine. Become informed and take an active role in your health. Know what will be implanted in your mouth. You must decide at the outset what is more important to you--the life of a filling or <i>your</i> life." <i>Uninformed Consent</i> will give you the facts so that you may take responsibility for your dental--and complete--health and wellness.<p></p></p><p>Dr. Huggins has spent 30 years developing a multidisciplinary approach to treating dentally toxic patients. He has a master's degree from the University of Colorado. <br> <br>Dr. Levy obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree from Johns Hopkins University, and graduated from Tulane University School of Medicine. He is board certified in both Internal Medicine and Cardiology. He also has a law degree from University of Denver.Doctors Huggins and Levy, who have spent years studying the toxic effects of dental materials, have written an authoritative book that accomplishes their stated purpose of "making the reader aware of the enormous and wide-ranging effects of dental toxicity." The authors have done an excellent job of describing the medical research in lay terms. They cover dental sources of toxicity, the body's reactions, specific diseases suspected or known to be caused by dental materials, and suggestions for dealing with such toxicity. Although a chapter with more clearly detailed information about alternative dental materials and detoxification methods would have been helpful, this work is well researched and well written.

It&#39;s an epidemic of free expression, carried by black artists, and its symptoms are an uncontrollable urge to dance, sing, laugh and jive. The state will stop at nothing to suppress the outbreak, but, deep in the heart of Harlem, private eye and Vodum priest Papa LaBas has other ideas - and, possibly, the key to everything. A freewheeling, explosive blend of jazz, ragtime, ancient myth, magic and conspiracy thriller, this anarchic postmodern classic is a satire for our times.</p><p>Novelist, poet, playwright, songwriter, essayist, activist and MacArthur genius, Ishmael Reed has been a major figure in American letters for the past four decades. His ground-breaking literary output has inspired generations of artists and writers - from Thomas Pynchon, Paul Beatty, and Colson Whitehead, to 2pac, George Clinton and David Murray - and he is widely recognized as one of the great American writers. Reed was born in 1938. He grew up in working-class neighbourhoods in Buffalo, New York, attended Buffalo public schools, and the University of Buffalo. He taught at Harvard, Yale, Dartmouth and, for thirty-five years, at the University of California Berkeley. He lives in Oakland, California, where he teaches at the California College of the Arts.Ishmael Reed&#39;s extraordinary and expansive collage novel [is] a conduit for his surging torrent of interrelating arguments about race, religion, history, music and literature ... it reminds readers of the charged relationship between medium and message, issuing an avant-garde challenge to read and to think as innovatively as they way in which the novel is written. Mumbo Jumbo is urgent, imaginative, hilarious, and deeply attuned to the exigencies of social and cultural capital. -- Rona Cran * Times Literary Supplement * A dazzling classic ... exhilarating ... like jazz, the novel feels improvisatory and ambitious [...] It is a funny book about conspiracy theories that nonetheless feels serious and true.

His selections from Byzantine writers as well as from more obscure documents and chronicles in Latin, Arabic, Slavic, Italian, Armenian, and French reflect all the diversity of Byzantine life&#x2014;the military tactics of the long-invincible cataphract cavalry and the warships armed with Greek fire, the mysticism of Hesychast monks, the duties of imperial officers, the activities of daily life from the Hippodrome and Hagia Sophia to the marketplaces, baths, and brothels. Geanakoplos not only covers the traditional areas of political, ecclesiastical, socioeconomic, administrative, and military life, but also provides a vivid picture of Byzantine culture&#x2014;education, philosophy, literature, theology, medicine, and science. Of particular interest are the insights into the empire's relations with the Latin West, the Slavs, the Arabs, the Turks, and other neighboring peoples.<br> <br> <i>Byzantium</i> is much more than a sourcebook. The running commentary reflects the most recent scholarly research in Byzantine studies and places each translated source in its precise historical context.

And, as Joseph E. Stiglitz explains, while those at the top enjoy the best health care, education, and benefits of wealth, they fail to realize that &#x201c;their fate is bound up with how the other 99 percent live.&#x201d;<br><br> Stiglitz draws on his deep understanding of economics to show that growing inequality is not inevitable: moneyed interests compound their wealth by stifling true, dynamic capitalism. They have made America the most unequal advanced industrial country while crippling growth, trampling on the rule of law, and undermining democracy. The result: a divided society that cannot tackle its most pressing problems. With characteristic insight, Stiglitz examines our current state, then teases out its implications for democracy, for monetary and budgetary policy, and for globalization. He closes with a plan for a more just and prosperous future.<br><br></p><p>Joseph E. Stiglitz is a Nobel Prize&#x2013;winning economist and the best- selling author of Globalization and Its Discontents Revisited: Anti- Globalization in the Age of Trump, The Price of Inequality, and Freefall. He teaches at Columbia University.&#x201c;Joseph E. Stiglitz's new book, <em>The Price of Inequality</em>, is the single most comprehensive counterargument to both Democratic neoliberalism and Republican laissez-faire theories. While credible economists running the gamut from center right to center left describe our bleak present as the result of seemingly unstoppable developments&#x2015;globalization and automation, a self-replicating establishment built on "meritocratic" competition, the debt-driven collapse of 2008&#x2015;Stiglitz stands apart in his defiant rejection of such notions of inevitability. He seeks to shift the terms of the debate.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Thomas B. Edsall, <em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Stiglitz writes clearly and provocatively. He&#x2019;s the kind of economist who can talk about terms such as 'rent-seeking' and the 'euro crisis' and bring readers along for the ride... Stiglitz isn&#x2019;t just writing about people being hurt by inequality, he is also writing about the system itself being in jeopardy and what needs to be done to fix it.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Dante Chinni, <em>Washington Post</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Concise and clearly argued.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;An impassioned argument backed by rigorous economic analysis.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;An important and smart new book...

Note that many of these use new features of ES5 or of HTML5, and will only work in the newest browsers:<br> 1) Example 1-1 is is an extended example in the first chapter of the book, intended to show readers a simple but non-trivial example of JavaScript. This is the loan calculator example from the last edition, but made much more interesting with the addition of client-side graphics, localStorage, and Ajax.<br> 2) Example 9-7 emulates Java-style enumerated types in JavaScript. It demonstrates that JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance is so flexible that factory methods can be normal object factories or even class factories. That example is a little clearer if you look at the code in Example 9-8.<br> 3) Example 9-16 defines a class hierarchy of abstract and concrete Set classes. This one is a favorite because it involves data types and API design. Chapter 9 includes a number of other Set examples, too.<br> 4) Example 9-23 demonstrates the ES5 Object.defineProperty() method and defines a convenient way to inspect and modify the attributes of the properties of an object. It may not be practical, but I think it is a beautiful hack. <br> 5) Example 15-10 is a simple stream-like API wrapped around the innerHTML property of an element. When you're generating text (a table, for example) for display it is sometimes easier to pass each chunk that you compute to a write() method than it is to concatenate it all together and set it on innerHTML.<br> 6) Example 21-03 is an analog clock implemented as an SVG graphic with scriptable hands. I love client-side graphics, and this is a favorite of mine because making the hands rotate is so simple with SVG transforms.<br> 7) Example 21-06 draws a fractal Koch snowflake using the tag. I like it because it draws the same line over and over again, but uses transformations to make the line appear at different locations, orientations and sizes.<br> 8) Example 21-13 is another graphical example: it draws sparklines (edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001OR). This one is a favorite just because sparklines are so cool.<br> 9) Example 22-1 uses the HTML5 geolocation API to find out where you are then uses the Google Maps API to obtain a static map of your location. I like it because geolocation (via wifi networks) is just pure magic!<br> 10) Example 22-15 is a long example that demonstrates the IndexedDB API. I like it because the idea of a client-side database in a web browser is crazy and cool.

In <i>The Soul of Care: The Moral Education of a Husband and a Doctor</i>, Kleinman delivers a deeply humane and inspiring story of his life in medicine and his marriage to Joan, and he describes the practical, emotional and moral aspects of caretaking. He also writes about the problems our society faces as medical technology advances and the cost of health care soars but caring for patients no longer seems important.<br><br>Caregiving is long, hard, unglamorous work--at moments joyous, more often tedious, sometimes agonizing, but it is always rich in meaning. In the face of our current political indifference and the challenge to the health care system, he emphasizes how we must ask uncomfortable questions of ourselves, and of our doctors. To give care, to be "present" for someone who needs us, and to feel and show kindness are deep emotional and moral experiences, enactments of our core values. The practice of caregiving teaches us what is most important in life, and reveals the very heart of what it is to be human.</p><p><b>Arthur Kleinman</b>, MD, is one of the most renowned and influential scholars and writers on psychiatry, anthropology, global health, and cultural issues in medicine.

He is a member of the National Academy of Medicine and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.One<br><br>Not much in my youth signaled a future of caregiving.<br><br>I never knew my biological father, Nathan Spier. Even as I write his name, I am unable to conjure a face or even a shadow. My mother, Marcia, ran away from him and from a marriage she couldn't tolerate, taking me with her, when I was one. I didn't know his full name or anything else about him until I was in my twenties, and even then, the subject remained radioactive enough in my family that I made no serious effort to find him. The mystery of my origins would haunt much of my young life. My own mother was unable to talk to me about my biological father and his family until she was in her sixties, and even then, she insisted that I should never meet him. A real estate developer, called the King of Bensonhurst as I later learned, he and his family had been involved in a scandal concerning illegal influence on the courts that resulted in the suicide of a judge. And to this day, that is all I permitted myself to know.<br><br>I grew up in a well-to-do Jewish family, in an economically and culturally mixed Brooklyn neighborhood. Our household, at least initially, consisted of my mother, my maternal grandparents, and me. My mother was a vivacious redhead (dyed) who loved the high life filled with nights out on the town, which she balanced with volunteer work in hospitals and for Jewish advocacy groups. She had the means to hire nurses and maids to look after me and, later, my brother. When she realized that I had played hooky from Hebrew school for several weeks, she assured me that I would indeed learn enough Hebrew to achieve my bar mitzvah, because she would not be denied the privilege of throwing a big party, as was expected in her circle. She made it clear throughout my childhood that I was to become a physician or a professor, or some other high-status professional whose intellectual achievements would add a patina of class and respectability to the family's financial success.<br><br>My mother was also high-strung and volatile. I never doubted her love, but at the same time, I found her emotionally untrustworthy. When my half brother came along, I never felt sure if her concern for me was as great as her worry about him. I sensed that she and the rest of the family saw me as more self-sufficient and able to look after myself. My stepfather would prove to be almost as much of a party animal as my mother, and their friendship networks included all kinds of colorful and sometimes slightly shady characters.<br><br>My mother was one of four daughters, but her father's clear favorite. It was for this reason that we lived with my grandparents. My grandfather, a proudly secular Jew of Russian background, had built a prosperous soap company and amassed real estate holdings. His business prospered in the 1930s and early '40s but went into precipitous decline in the postwar years.<br><br>My grandfather was, I imagine, typical for his times, but would seem totally out of place in the second decade of the twenty-first century. He was formal, distant, and authoritarian. He didn't express his love in words but in deeds, protecting and often defending me when neighbors and shopkeepers objected to my delinquent behavior. I remember one Saturday morning, when the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneerson, a monumental figure in the Hasidic Jewish community who had recently moved next door, took away the basketball I was dribbling and told me not to play on the Sabbath. It was my grandfather who retrieved my basketball from the Rebbe and admonished me to play with it outside every Saturday from then on. He was at the very center of the family-a loving paterfamilias-and he carried as an almost sacred duty the responsibility for our financial and social security. I admired my grandfather, and always felt secure under his protective wing but never felt emotionally close to him.<br><br>In contrast to my high-living mother, my grandmother was old-world, a poorly educated, superstitious, and increasingly paranoid matriarch who never left the house and who occasionally whispered to me that I came from an even richer family. Her mysterious mutterings only further confused and disturbed me, since she would stubbornly refuse to elaborate, no matter how hard I questioned her.<br><br>These older generations saw me as a willful, headstrong little boy, naturally resistant to authority. In the family's folklore, these traits were forged at birth, when I emerged from the birth canal with the umbilical cord wrapped tightly around my neck, blue and struggling to breathe. In their eyes, I was born a fighter, and it's fair to say that I did little to dissuade them from that notion as I grew up.<br><br>In 1943, when I was two years old, my mother absconded with me to Miami, so as to thwart my biological father, who was trying to use legal means to compel our return. (Apparently, Florida did not recognize New York State's marriage laws then.) For a while we lived across from a hostel for army and navy officers, several of whom took an interest in my mother. I remember asking each one plaintively but with hope, "Are you my father?" Perhaps this sense of loss and longing contributed more to my aggressive willfulness than any birth trauma I might have experienced. At any rate, my behavior got bad enough that my frustrated kindergarten teacher insisted my mother remove me from the classroom. "He only does things his own way," she complained.<br><br>My mother met the man who would become my stepfather during that brief sojourn in Florida. Peter Kleinman had played professional basketball and was a minor celebrity in his day. He was good-looking, friendly and charming, and admired by many. I admired him, too, when I was young. As I grew older, though, I could see that my grandfather regarded him as a failure in business and in his law practice, and with good reason. I think even my mother, who loved her new husband, came to share this view. I could feel my stepfather's love and concern for me-he was the man I saw as my dad-but I understood and accepted that he loved my brother, his natural son, more. Peter Kleinman would adopt me when I was twelve, changing my name from Arthur Spier (pronounced "Spear") to Arthur Kleinman, so that it felt as if I was starting out anew.<br><br>In the decade after my grandfather's death in 1958, during which time my stepfather stopped working, he and my mother together spent her entire inheritance. I didn't feel the loss of the family's financial security as deeply as the resentment, embarrassment, and maybe even shame over the irresponsibility of my parents, who had put the family-meaning my brother and me-second. This was quite the opposite of the example set by my grandfather.<br><br>My kindergarten teacher wasn't completely wrong about me. I remember an episode from around that same time, when I angrily informed my mother I was running away from home. When my mother opened the door I had so dramatically slammed on the way out, she found me sitting on the steps. I couldn't go any further, I explained, because I was not allowed to cross the street on my own! Clearly, there was something in my nature, even at this early time, which acted as a natural brake on my impulsiveness. I could be difficult, but I knew there were rules and directives that needed to be followed. And I was not so foolhardy as to do something that would cause me to injure myself. This fundamental awareness would keep me out of trouble time and again during my childhood, or at least it helped keep that trouble to a mostly manageable level.<br><br>Back in Brooklyn, I attended a public school four blocks from our house. Our Crown Heights neighborhood was a mainly Jewish enclave surrounded by Irish and Italian communities, where apartment blocks thrust their dark brick facades from between brighter rows of sturdy single-family houses. In the street, we boys played stickball or punchball, bought vanilla or chocolate cones from the ice cream truck, shot marbles, flipped coins, watched the girls play hopscotch, experimented with cigarettes, and fought with one another to see who was the toughest. Nobody bothered to hide their racism or anti-Semitism in the 1940s and early '50s, and I got into many fights on the streets outside our little enclave on account of being Jewish and unwilling, to a point anyway, to back down. But there must have been more than this at stake for me because I fought with Jewish boys too.<br><br>My life on the street from 1944 to 1953 contrasted sharply with the cushy existence at home, where we had a cook and a housekeeper and I never had so much as a chore to do. I was given to understand that I would always be financially secure and that the family would always take care of me-not exactly the best message to encourage my sense of responsibility and stewardship. I treated myself from childhood on with a carelessness that was surely compounded by my mother's distraction with a new marriage that had produced a new child. I neglected my health, as did most kids then, I suppose, and have suffered the consequences ever since, with dental problems, asthma, melanoma, and other ailments.<br><br>My neighborhood friends came from hardworking ethnic families, and most were not well off like mine. I spent my childhood with these tough working-class kids, instinctively understanding that the best way to survive the bullies and the street fighters was to become one of them. I learned to take care of myself, teasing, hassling, and abusing other kids just for the sport of it. I was becoming not just tough, but hard.<br><br>And yet that same instinct that kept me from crossing the street when I wanted to run away from home must have also tempered the worst of my behavior toward others. It was partly a nascent awareness of the need for self-protective boundaries, but also an awakening sense of the emotional and moral responsibilities of relationships. Around age ten or eleven, when girls started to come into focus, I developed a childhood crush on one in particular. But the conventions of courtship entirely escaped me. I think I must have believed that I had the right to help myself to whatever captured my fancy. At the end of the school day as we all left to walk home, I asked her if I could carry her books. It never occurred to me that I might be rebuffed, and when she said "No!" I impulsively grabbed the books and ran away. It took only a few moments to recognize I had done something shameful and for a hopeful suitor terminally unhelpful, so I returned her books with a burning feeling in my face and chest.<br><br>At the same age, an older boy in the playground tried to wrench my brand-new basketball from my hands. When I refused to let go, he banged my head repeatedly against the steel pole that supported the hoop. My head was bleeding, but I refused to cry in front of him or the other kids who had gathered around, or beg for the ball back. I ran home believing my dignity was still intact but bearing the wounds of battle. I wasn't angry about the injustice done to me; I was just burning for revenge. I would show I would not be trifled with or cowed. I would strike back. I had watched and learned. But all I had really learned is what every bully knows: you pick fights with those you can defeat and humiliate.<br><br>I came to the cynical understanding that beneath its orderly and proper exterior, it is a violent world without justice or goodness. I learned another brutal lesson, also not compatible with caregiving, in a fight with another aggressive boy who lived on the block. Following a minute of grappling and hitting, I locked my arms around his head and squeezed as hard as I could. He started to cry and begged me to stop. So I released my hold, only to have him crush my neck with a hammerlock that was so tight I couldn't breathe. I gave up, and he celebrated his victory by laughing at me. It would take me a long time to unlearn the lesson this particular beating taught me: to resist empathizing with my enemies, to take no pity, no mercy.<br><br>Every now and then, though, the light found its way through a crack in my armor. One summer when I was eleven or twelve, I had gone to a summer camp in upstate New York, where I joined with the other more rugged campers in making fun of a small, bespectacled boy who avoided sports and always carried a book around. But his surprising response to our teasing-arguing that he was becoming serious about intellectual matters-was so passionate, so mature, and yet carried lightly with a self-deprecating humor that I felt a respect and even admiration for him. This boy was also caring. When I got hit in the head with a softball pitch, he ran over to see if I was all right. I knew I liked him and what he stood for, which was so very different from the rest of my experience. I couldn't recall having felt that way before, except for the tough kids whose coarse behavior I emulated. I remember wondering if there might be a way to be like him and also still be myself. This was one of the first times in my life that I actually began to see that there was a part of me that wasn't being cultivated at all, and perhaps was even being stifled by my hard shell.<br><br>Yet even on those tough streets occasionally there was evidence that friends had your back, at least when you were threatened by "outsiders," such as kids from other neighborhoods, older kids who belonged to rival gangs, or the police. I remember a time when everybody knew about a big gang fight among high schoolers that was to take place in a park near my school. I was very excited and planned to go. Two of my friends prevented me from going, insisting that if I got involved, even as an observer, I was likely to get into more serious trouble. At a nearby movie theater for a Saturday matinee, a fight started several rows behind where I was sitting with friends. I started out of my seat to take a closer look at the action, but one of my classmates abruptly pulled me back by the collar of my jacket, saying, "Come on, they have knives. We are getting out of here!" Could we call these school chums and street friends a social network that functioned as a caring circle? If I had used words like these with them I doubtless would have been laughed at and ridiculed. But there was a kind of incipient care among us that held fast despite the otherwise brutal atmosphere of carelessness and violence. We shared a local world, and knew it, and we were learning how to care for one another.</p><h2>Tortall: A Spy&#39;s Guide</h2><p><b>The must-have guide for any fan of #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling fantasy author TAMORA PIERCE!

Deep in the forests, under the pretense of battling Maoist guerillas, the Indian government is waging a vicious total war against its own citizens-a war undocumented by a weak domestic press and fostered by corporations eager to exploit the rare minerals buried in tribal lands. Roy takes readers to the unseen front lines of this ongoing battle, chronicling her months spent living with the rebel guerillas in the forests. In documenting their local struggles, Roy addresses the much larger question of whether global capitalism will tolerate any societies existing outside of its colossal control.<br><br>"A riveting account . . .&nbsp;a necessary book by one of India&#x2019;s most distinctive voices." -<i>Washington Post</i></p><p><b>Arundhati Roy</b> is the author of <i>The God of Small Things</i>, winner of the prestigious Man Booker Prize.

But when they discover five girls have been murdered in Bethnal Green, taunting letters begin to arrive in Craig's Court from a killer calling himself Mr. Miacca. <br> <br> Barker fears that Miacca might be part of the Hellfire Club, a group of powerful, hedonistic aristocrats performing Satanic rituals. He must track the fiend to his hideout, while Llewelyn confronts the man who put him in prison. <br> <br> Dodging muckrakers, navigating the murky Thames under cover of darkness, and infiltrating London's most powerful secret society, <i>The Hellfire Conspiracy</i> is another wild ride that "brings to life a London roiling with secret leagues, deadly organizations, and hidden clubs" (Ron Bernas, <i>Detroit Free Press</i>).</p><p><b>Will Thomas</b> is the author of <i>Some Danger Involved,</i> the first novel featuring Cyrus Barker and Thomas Llewelyn, and now a Barry and Shamus Award nominee. He lives with his family in Oklahoma.At the start of Thomas's well-crafted fourth Barker and Llewelyn mystery to feature a London detective duo clearly modeled on Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson (after 2006's <i>The Limehouse Text</i>), a distraught guardsman, Major DeVere, consults Cyrus Barker, a smugly intellectual private enquiry agent, and his young apprentice, ex-con Thomas Llewelyn. The major's 12-year-old daughter has disappeared, and DeVere fears she has fallen victim to white slavers, though the sleuths suspect a serial killer may be at work. The plot thickens when Barker receives a taunting letter in rhyme signed Mr. Miacca, a child-eating bogeyman from a bedtime story. Scotland Yard hampers the investigation in a possible coverup of some upper-class depravities. The taut plotting, interesting variations on familiar themes and incorporation of some of the political issues of the day elevate the series above most pastiches, though veteran mystery readers won't be too surprised at the killer's identity. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

During that time, he's had work published by nearly every comics publisher in the business, and he's created many critically acclaimed comic book series, including <i>Elementals, Coventry, Proposition Players</i>, and of course the seminal Vertigo series <i>Fables</i>, as well as its spin-off series <i>Fairest, Jack of Fables</i> and <i>The Literals</i>. His work has been nominated for many awards, including the Eisner, Harvey, and Ignatz comic industry awards and the International Horror Guild award. He lives somewhere near a good poker room.<br><br>Born in 1966 in the English seaside town of Clevedon, <b>Mark Buckingham</b> has worked in comics professionally for the past twenty years. In addition to illustrating all of Neil Gaiman's run on the post-Alan Moore <i>Miracleman</i> in the early 1990s, Buckingham contributed inks to <i>The Sandman</i> and its related miniseries <i>Death: The High Cost of Living</i> and <i>Death: The Time of Your Life</i> as well as working on various other titles for Vertigo and Marvel through the end of the decade. In 2002 he took over as the penciller for Bill Willingham's <i>Fables</i>, which has gone on to become one of the most popular and critically acclaimed Vertigo titles of the new millennium. When not in Clevedon, Buckingham can be found with his wife Irma in the Asturias region of northern Spain.One of the stories in this new collection is appropriately titled "Into the Woods." Like Stephen Sondheim's musical, Willingham's series presents figures from childhood fairytales contending with the problems of adult life. Snow White, Briar Rose (aka Sleeping Beauty), Prince Charming, Little Boy Blue and Goldilocks all appear, as does a trickster named Jack. So does the Big Bad Wolf, who is inescapably reminiscent of Marvel's Wolverine. Even Gulliver's Lilliputians turn up, as do talking animals. This volume collects issues 11 through 18, and, as with many contemporary comics, it will be difficult for readers who haven't started with the first issue to get their bearings. The fairytale characters comprise a community of immortals known as "Fables," who now hide in plain sight from the mundane normal people (known as "mundys," they're much like J.K. Rowling's muggles) in a section of New York City called Fabletown. The stories are of two sorts. Two stand-alone tales take place in past centuries and have a genuine fairytale feel and period charm. The others, set in the present, are gritty, with dysfunctional relationships, blackmail and murder attempts. Take the "mature audiences" advisory seriously: this is a book in which an adult Goldilocks can be seen naked or covered with blood. Despite its darker elements, <i>Fables </i>features wit and comedy; Willingham can even make scenes simultaneously farcical and horrific. The art ranges from the illustrative to cartoony, and its variety mirrors the stories' many moods. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Still, when detectives asked for victims to come forward, she sent a note.<br>Her criminal case file reopened, she saw for the first time evidence that corroborated her memories. Here were depictions of the na�ve, hard-working girl she'd been, a chorister and debater, the daughter of a priest; of the two senior athletes who assaulted her and were allowed to graduate with awards; and of the faculty, doctors, and priests who had known about Crawford's assault and gone to great lengths to bury it.<br>Now a wife, mother, and writer living on the other side of the country, Crawford learned that police had uncovered astonishing proof of an institutional silencing years before, and that unnamed powers were still trying to block her case. The slander, innuendo, and lack of adult concern that Crawford had experienced as a student hadn't been imagined as the effects of trauma, after all: these were the actions of a school that prized its reputation above anything, even a child.<br>This revelation launched Crawford on an extraordinary inquiry into the ways gender, privilege, and power shaped her experience as a girl at the gates of America's elite. Her investigation looks beyond the sprawling playing fields and soaring chapel towers of crucibles of power like St. Paul's, whose reckoning is still to come. And it runs deep into the channels of shame and guilt, witness and silencing, that dictate who can speak and who is heard in American society.<br>An insightful, mature, beautifully written memoir, <i>Notes on a Silencing</i> is an arresting coming-of-age story that wrestles with an essential question for our time: what telling of a survivor's story will finally force a remedy?</p><p>Lacy Crawford is the author of the novel <i>Early Decision.</i> She lives in Southern California with her family.<b>Praise for Lacy Crawford's <i>Early Decision</i></b><br><br>"Part<i> Gossip Girl</i>, part<i> Dead Poets Society</i>, and entirely addictive!

More than two decades after the end of the Cold War, the U.S. still stations its troops at nearly a thousand locations in foreign lands. These bases are usually taken for granted or overlooked entirely, a little-noticed part of the Pentagon's vast operations. But in an eye-opening account, <i>Base Nation</i> shows that the worldwide network of bases brings with it a panoply of ills&#x2015;and actually makes the nation less safe in the long run.</p><p>As David Vine demonstrates, the overseas bases raise geopolitical tensions and provoke widespread antipathy towards the United States. They also undermine American democratic ideals, pushing the U.S. into partnerships with dictators and perpetuating a system of second-class citizenship in territories like Guam. They breed sexual violence, destroy the environment, and damage local economies. And their financial cost is staggering: though the Pentagon underplays the numbers, Vine's accounting proves that the bill approaches $100 billion per year.</p><p>For many decades, the need for overseas bases has been a quasi-religious dictum of U.S. foreign policy. But in recent years, a bipartisan coalition has finally started to question this conventional wisdom. With the U.S. withdrawing from Afghanistan and ending thirteen years of war, there is no better time to re-examine the tenets of our military strategy.

An entreaty for an explanation, a discussion in plain language, about what the U.S. military is doing in so many places in the world and why.&#x201d;<br><i><b>&#x2015;The Washington Post</b></i></p><p>"U.S. national security policy rests on the assertion that 'forward presence' contributes directly to global peace and security. In this powerful book, David Vine examines, dismantles, and disproves that claim. He demonstrates that America's sprawling network of overseas bases imposes costs&#x2015;not only financial but also political, environmental, and moral&#x2015;that far exceed what the Pentagon is prepared to acknowledge. <i>Base Nation</i> offers a devastating critique, and no doubt Washington will try to ignore it. Citizens should refuse to let that happen.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2015;Andrew J. Bacevich, author of <i>Limits of Power</i> and <i>Breach of Trust</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;Who knew that we have more than eight hundred bases around the world? And what do our troops do there when they're not busy intruding into other people's conflicts? Such questions lie at the heart of David Vine's remarkable, impeccably written, and clearheaded analysis of the costly madness that is America's current colonial-military complex. His book is a marvel, and all in power should read it.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2015;Simon Winchester, author of <i>Atlantic</i> and <i>The Men Who United the States</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;Just looking at the maps in David Vine's thoroughly documented <i>Base Nation</i> will give you the chills&#x2015;and seduce you into reading the book. He's performed a kind of modern day treasure hunt, finding and displaying our military forces all over the globe, and then thinking deeply about whether their far-flung presence will achieve or undermine the goal of fostering a peaceful and prosperous world.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2015;Dana Priest, coauthor of <i>Top Secret America</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;While I may not share all of David Vine's conclusions, <i>Base Nation</i> amply demonstrates what a growing number of people across the political spectrum are concluding: the foundation of our military belongs right here on American soil. In the U.S. Senate, I pushed for greater investment in our bases here at home where our forces have greater unrestricted training opportunities and can rapidly deploy worldwide better prepared for combat. Pentagon officials and members of Congress should pay close attention to Vine's arguments in favor of reducing our foreign presence in the interest of strengthening the future security posture of U.S. military forces and the fiscal health of our nation.&#x201d; <br><b>&#x2015;Kay Bailey Hutchison, former U.S. senator (R-TX) and chair of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee for Military Construction</b></p></p><h2>Haunted Air</h2><p><strong>Anonymous Halloween photographs from c.1875&#x2013;1955&#x2014;truly haunting&nbsp;Americana, with a foreword by David Lynch</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>The photographs in <i>Haunted Air</i> provide an extraordinary glimpse into the traditions of this macabre festival from ages past, and form an important document of photographic history. These are the pictures of the dead: family portraits, mementos of the treasured, now unrecognizable, and&nbsp;others. The roots of Halloween lie in the ancient pre&#x2013;Christian Celtic festival of Samhain, a feast to mark the death of the old year and the birth of the new. It was believed that on this night the veil separating the worlds of the living and the dead grew thin and ruptured, allowing spirits to pass through and walk unseen but not unheard amongst men. The advent of Christianity saw the pagan festival subsumed in All Souls' Day, when across Europe the dead were mourned and venerated. Children and the poor, often masked or in outlandish costume, wandered the night begging "soul cakes" in exchange for prayers, and fires burned to keep malevolent phantoms at bay. From Europe, the haunted tradition would quickly take root and flourish in the fertile soil of the New World. Feeding hungrily on fresh lore, consuming half&#x2013;remembered tales of its own shadowy origins and rituals, Halloween was reborn in America. The pumpkin supplanted the carved turnip; costumes grew ever stranger, and celebrants both rural and urban seized gleefully on the festival's intoxicating, lawless spirit. For one wild night, the dead stared into the faces of the living, and the living, ghoulishly masked and clad in tattered backwoods baroque, stared back. </strong></p><p><b>Ossian Brown</b> is an artist, musician, and composer&nbsp;who&nbsp;was a member of the music group Coil, and is a cofounding member of Cyclobe. <b>David Lynch</b> is the author of <i>Catching the Big Fish: Meditation, Consciousness, and Creativity</i> as well as<i> </i>a three&#x2013;time&nbsp;Oscar&#x2013;nominated&nbsp;director whose&nbsp;popular and critically acclaimed films include <i>Eraserhead</i>, <i>Wild at Heart</i>, <i>Twin Peaks</i>, <i>Blue Velvet</i>, <i>Mulholland Drive</i>, and <i>Inland Empire</i>. <b>Geoff Cox</b> works in film and is the author of <i>Anna &amp; the Witch's Bottle</i>."for those into the history of Halloween and the common-day costumes worn, this book may be necessary in&nbsp;your collection."&#x2014;"Selectism" blog<br><br>"an exquisite collection of antique vernacular photographs of Halloweens past"&#x2014;Boing Boing<br><br>"recommended for collectors of Americana and those with an interest in the history of Halloween."&#x2014;Library Journal's Xpress Reviews<br><br>"delightfully dreadful."&#x2014;NPR's "The Picture Show" photo blog<br><br>"The emotional triggers of these moments in time have only become more subtle and complex with age."&nbsp;&#x2014; GeekTyrant.com&nbsp;<br><br>"bewitching collection of found American Halloween photographs from 1875-1955." &#x2014;VMAN&nbsp;Magazine<br><br>"Creepy." &#x2014;Rolling Stone</p><h2>A Hero Born: The Definitive Edition (Legends of the Condor Heroes, 1)</h2><p><p><b>The epic Chinese classic and phenomenon published in the US for the first time! </b><br><b></b><br><b>Featured in iO9's <i>2019 Fall Preview.</i></b></p><p><i>Set in ancient China, in a world where kung fu is magic, kingdoms vie for power and the battle to become the ultimate kung fu master unfolds, an unlikely hero is born... in the first book in the epic </i>Legends of the Condor Heroes <i>series by the critically acclaimed master of the genre, Jin Yong.</i></p><p>After his father&#x2015;a devoted Song patriot&#x2015;is murdered by the Jin empire, Guo Jing and his mother flee to the plains of Ghengis Khan and his people for refuge.

The crowds that gathered outside Sand Cave turned the rescue site into a carnival. Collins&#39;s situation was front-page news throughout the country, hourly bulletins interrupted radio programs, and Congress recessed to hear the latest word. Trapped! is both a tense adventure and a brilliant historical recreation of the past. This new edition includes a new epilogue revealing information about the Floyed Collins story that has come to light since the book was first published.</p><p>ROGER W. BRUCKER is an American cave explorer and author of books about caves. He helped create the Cave Research Foundation, which set new standards for cave exploration, and co-authored The Longest Cave about Kentucky s Mammoth Cave. <p> ROBERT K. MURRAY is professor emeritus and former chairman of the department of history at Pennsylvania State University.</p>At the opening of this real-life story, young Floyd Collins&#39;s foot becomes trapped under a boulder in a cave he has undertaken to explore alone. Leaving us in suspense, time regresses to provide the dramatis personae and historical information that lead up to the cliff-hanging moment, which was one of the biggest news stories between the two World Wars. The return to 1925 finds Floyd still stuck, and efforts to free him don&#39;t go well. Narrator Joe Barrett&#39;s sandy voice alternates between his normal speech and the rural accent of central Kentucky, where the story takes place. Barrett amplifies the suspense by modulating his intensity in synchrony with the hero&#39;s vicissitudes. He imitates Floyd&#39;s pitiful cries for help and food as the boy drifts to the far edge of sanity. Floyd&#39;s uncertain fate makes the true story difficult to pause. J.A.H.

Instantly and persistently controversial, the concept of natural selection transformed scientific analysis about all life on Earth. Before<i>&nbsp;</i>the<i> Origin of Species</i>, accepted thinking held that life was the static and perfect creation of God. By a single, systematic argument Darwin called this view into question. His ideas have affected public perception of everything from religion to economics. William Bynum's introduction discusses Darwin's life, the publication and reception of the themes of<i> On the Origin of Species</i>, and the subsequent development of its major themes. The new edition also includes brief biographies of some of the most important scientific thinkers leading up to and surrounding the <i>Origin of Species</i>, suggested further reading, notes and a chronology.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700&nbsp;titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the&nbsp;series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date&nbsp;translations by award-winning translators.</p><p>It's hard to talk about <i>The Origin of Species</i> without making statements that seem overwrought and fulsome. But it's true: this is indeed one of the most important and influential books ever written, and it is one of the very few groundbreaking works of science that is truly readable. <p> To a certain extent it suffers from the Hamlet problem--it's full of clich�s! Or what are now clich�s, but which Darwin was the first to pen. Natural selection, variation, the struggle for existence, survival of the fittest: it's all in here.</p> <p> Darwin's friend and "bulldog" T.H. Huxley said upon reading the <i>Origin</i>, "How extremely stupid of me not to have thought of that." Alfred Russel Wallace had thought of the same theory of evolution Darwin did, but it was Darwin who gathered the mass of supporting evidence--on domestic animals and plants, on variability, on sexual selection, on dispersal--that swept most scientists before it. It's hardly necessary to mention that the book is still controversial: Darwin's remark in his conclusion that "Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history" is surely the pinnacle of British understatement. <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i></p>Jim Endersby&#39;s major new scholarly edition debunks some of the myths that surround Darwin&#39;s book, and expores how it was originally written, published and read. Endersby provides a new, up-to-date and very readable introduction to this classic text and a level of scholarly apparatus unmatched by any other edition.</p><h2>The Portable Voltaire (Portable Library)</h2><p>Includes Part One of <i>Candide</i>; three stories; selections from <i>The Philosophical Dictionary, The Lisbon Earthquake</i>, and other works; and thirty-five letters.</p><p><b>Fran�ois-Marie Arouet</b>, writing under the pseudonym <b>Voltaire</b>, was born in 1694 into a Parisian bourgeois family. Educated by Jesuits, he was an excellent pupil but one quickly enraged by dogma. An early rift with his father&#x2014;who wished him to study law&#x2014;led to his choice of letters as a career. Insinuating himself into court circles, he became notorious for lampoons on leading notables and was twice imprisoned in the Bastille.<p>By his mid-thirties his literary activities precipitated a four-year exile in England where he won the praise of Swift and Pope for his political tracts. His publication, three years later in France, of <b>Lettres philosophiques sur les Anglais</b> (1733)&#x2014;an attack on French Church and State&#x2014;forced him to flee again. For twenty years Voltaire lived chiefly away from Paris. In this, his most prolific period, he wrote such satirical tales as &#x201c;<b>Zadig</b>&#x201d; (1747) and &#x201c;<b>Candide</b>&#x201d; (1759). His old age at Ferney, outside Geneva, was made bright by his adopted daughter, &#x201c;Belle et Bonne,&#x201d; and marked by his intercessions in behalf of victims of political injustice. Sharp-witted and lean in his white wig, impatient with all appropriate rituals, he died in Paris in 1778&#x2014;the foremost French author of his day.</p></p><h2>Father Marquette and the Great Rivers (Vision Books)</h2><p><p></p><p>This Vision book for youth 9 - 15 years old tells the thrilling story of one of America's greatest missionaries who came down from Canada with explorer Louis Joliet to explore the mighty Mississippi River, the "great river" bordered by Indian tribes who killed white men on sight.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Of the few who had dared explore this immense waterway, none had lived to return and report where it emptied. If he could travel to the mouth of the "great river", Fr. Marquette hoped to obtain new lands for France and new souls for Jesus Christ. He braved the dangers of tomahawks and tortures to bring the Word of God to the Indians of the New World. Rapids, floods, Indian superstitions, tribal warfare - these are only a few of the obstacles Father Marquette and Louis Joliet encountered in trying to meet their challenge.&nbsp;<i>Illustrated.</i></p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>The Goal</h2><p><p>Alex Rogo is a harried plant manager working ever more desperately to try and improve performance. His factory is rapidly heading for disaster. So is his marriage. He has ninety days to save his plant - or it will be closed by corporate HQ, with hundreds of job losses. It takes a chance meeting with a colleague from student days - Jonah - to help him break out of conventional ways of thinking to see what needs to be done. </p> <p>Described by Fortune as a 'guru to industry' and by Businessweek as a 'genius', Eliyahu M.

This 20th anniversary edition includes a series of detailed case study interviews by David Whitford, Editor at Large, Fortune Small Business, which explore how organizations around the world have been transformed by Eli Goldratt's ideas. </p> <p>The story of Alex's fight to save his plant contains a serious message for all managers in industry and explains the ideas which underline the Theory of Constraints (TOC) developed by Eli Goldratt.&nbsp;Written in a fast-paced thriller style, The Goal is the gripping novel which is transforming management thinking throughout the Western world.&nbsp;It is a book to recommend to your friends in industry - even to your bosses - but not to your competitors!</p></p><p>Eliyahu M. Goldratt was an internationally recognized leader in the development of new business management concepts and systems, and acted as an educator to many of the world&#39;s corporations.A novel, business lesson, and wake-up call for leaders whose companies are bogged down by complacency, sloppy thinking, and bureaucratic stupidity, this 1984 text is anchored by the comforting voice of Eric Conger and a strong cast of voice actors who handle the material with immense skill. They deftly balance between the need to jazz up the dry business content and the temptation to succumb to the story's melodrama. The heroic story line seems hindered by extraneous dialogue and subplots, but the voice performances make the production hard to fault as a listening experience. The main point is that companies are profitable when archaic habits are persistently reexamined with fresh eyes for constraints and bottlenecks.

"They are a kind of collective dreaming, filled with timeless symbols and images we can all relate to, regardless of age or culture. And, much as an oyster must be disturbed by a grain of sand in order for the pearl to be created, I often choose to retell stories in which I find unresolved fragments that are somehow perplexing to me."</p><p>Though widely known as a children's book writer, Marianna Mayer's early education focused on visual art. "It seems to me there was never a time when I didn't want to be an artist, " she says. "I liked to tell stories with pictures and compose music. My sister and I put on plays made up from my stories. And then I decided to start writing a book, at the age of nine." She published her first book at the age of nineteen. After college, she studied painting at the Art Students League in New York City. Her experiences as an artist provided many images that she began to incorporate into writing. Gradually, she shifted to the written word as a medium of expression. She explains, "I began to feel more freedom when using words as my paints and plots as my canvases.</p><p>"While in the midst of a writing project, I live so much in my mind that what takes place in my imagination becomes quite real to me. I try to become part of the culture of a particular tale as much as possible. While working on<em> Baba Yaga and Vasilisa the Brave,</em> for example, I read all I could about Russia. What I learned about Slavic mythology helped to deepen my understanding of the story. I listened to Russian music, ate Russian food (which I love!), and tried in other small ways to enter into the essence of that culture."</p><p>"My writing is deeply personal. First and foremost I write for the child who still lives within me. Then to the child in others, whether that child resides in a young person or an adult. I'm striving to reach out to that spirit of wonder within us all. The stories I was told as a child, those half-remembered folktales and myths, have become the foundation for what I continue to work on in my books. The sense of hope that books instilled in me as a child saw me through many difficult times. Because of this, I choose characters who face overwhelming odds but triumph through courage and perseverance. Similarly, myth allows a child to believe in his or her own dreams and can instill a boundless hope for the future."</p><br><br><p>Kinuko Y.

Sent to Baba Yaga's house to fetch a light, the girl becomes the witch's servant and is given a series of impossible tasks to perform. With the help of her doll, she pleases the demanding hag, who sends her home with the precious light. After it destroys her stepmother and stepsisters, Vasilisa goes to live with an elderly woman and learns to spin and weave. She creates an exquisite piece of cloth that catches the attention of the tsar. He seeks out its maker, finds the heroine, and asks for her hand in marriage. Mayer's graceful prose conveys both the wonder and power of the tale. Complementing the text are Craft's illustrations done in a mixture of watercolor, gouache, and oils. The palette of red and gold set against a dark background resembles Russian folk-art paintings on black-lacquered wood. The pictures are often dark, and the depiction of Baba Yaga is not for the weakhearted. The use of decorative capital letters, elegant typeface, and small drolleries add to the visual appeal of each page. A stylized and classy offering that's ideal for older picture-book audiences.<br><i>Denise Anton Wright, Illinois State University, Normal</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Stowed Away (A Maine Clambake Mystery)</h2><p><i>It&#x2019;s June in Busman&#x2019;s Harbor, Maine, and Julia Snowden and her family are working hard to get their authentic Maine clambake business ready for summer.</i> <i>Preparations must be put on hold, however, when a mysterious yacht drops anchor in the harbor&#x2014;and delivers an unexpected dose of murder . . .</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> When Julia&#x2019;s old prep school rival Wyatt Jayne invites her to dinner on board her billionaire fianc�&#x2019;s decked-out yacht, Julia arrives to find a sumptuous table set for two&#x2014;and the yachtsman dead in his chair.

Out of the last hours of Virgil&#39;s life and the final stirrings of his consciousness, the Austrian writer Hermann Broch fashioned one of the great works of twentieth-century modernism, a book that embraces an entire world and renders it with an immediacy that is at once sensual and profound. Begun while Broch was imprisoned in a German concentration camp, The Death of Virgil is part historical novel and part prose poem -- and always an intensely musical and immensely evocative meditation on the relation between life and death, the ancient and the modern.</p><p>"Broch is the greatest novelist European literature has produced since Joyce, and...The Death of Virgil represents the only genuine technical advance that fiction has made since Ulysses." -- George Steiner<p>"Hermann Broch belongs in that tradition of great twentieth-century novelists who have transformed, almost beyond recognition, one of the classic art forms of the nineteenth century."</p><p>-- Hannah Arendt</p><b>Hermann Broch</b>&nbsp;(1886&#x2013;1951) was born in Vienna, Austria, where he trained as an engineer and studied philosophy and mathematics. He gradually increased his involvement in the intellectual life of Vienna, becoming acquainted with Ludwig Wittgenstein, Sigmund Freud, and Robert Musil, among others.&nbsp;<i>The Sleepwalkers</i>&nbsp;was his first major work. In 1938, he was imprisoned as a subversive by the Nazis, but was freed and fled to the United States. In the years before his death, he was researching mass psychology at Yale University.&nbsp;<i>The Death of Virgil</i>&nbsp;originally appeared in 1945; his last major novel,&nbsp;<i>The Guiltless</i>, was published in 1950.</p><h2>The Perfect Speculator</h2><p>Brad Koteshwar, the author of The Perfect Speculator, first came to be known for his report on a phenomenal 7000% price run in 52 weeks by Taser International&#39;s stock. When he released that report he had written for his clients as a fiction and looked for publicity in the local Arizona media, he was rebuffed as the who&#39;s who in the small but affluent communities of Arizona were all owners of Taser stocks. None of them wanted to believe that the stock price on Taser had topped out in April 2004. In this book, Brad Koteshwar continues the simple lessons of the stock market in a teacher and student format using the character of Boyd Hunt, a master speculator, as the teacher. In this day and age where fast, loose and easy money is hawked by the hundreds of stock market books, the author shows how the old, tried and true principles have always worked in past market cycles and will continue to work in future market cycles.</p><p></p><h2>An Introduction to Statistical Problem Solving in Geography, Third Edition</h2><p>Now in its third edition, this highly regarded text has firmly established itself as the definitive introduction to geographical statistics. Assuming no reader background in statistics, the authors lay out the proper role of statistical analysis and methods in human and physical geography. They delve into the calculation of descriptive summaries and graphics, the use of inferential statistics as exploratory and descriptive tools, ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests and different spatial statistics to explore geographic patterns, inferential spatial statistics, and spatial autocorrelation and variograms.<p> The authors maintain an exploratory and investigative approach throughout, providing readers with real-world geographic issues and more than 50 map examples. Concepts are explained clearly and narratively without oversimplification. Each chapter concludes with a list of major goals and objectives. An epilogue offers over 150 geographic situations, inviting students to apply their new statistical skills to solve problems currently affecting our world. The accompanying CD provides data sets for many of the book's examples, appropriate for use with a variety of statistical and GIS software.</p></p><p>"Rather than dreading statistics, this book shows students the value of a multitude of techniques and how to select the best one for a particular problem. Equally important, the authors show students how to <i>interpret</i> the results of their analysis." --<i>The Pennsylvania Geographer</i><br><br>"It's a great book, especially for geography students who do not have much background in stats. Detailed text description is very useful for students to understand some of the complicated stats concepts." --Daoqin Tong, University of Arizona<br><br>"This easy-to-understand book is a great resource for students. It is full of practical examples in plain English. The authors have presented and explained otherwise complicated topics of statistic in a manner that any college student can easily comprehend." --Bhuiyan Alam, University of Toledo</p><h2>Escaping Salem: The Other Witch Hunt of 1692 (New Narratives in American History)</h2><p>The Salem witch hunt of 1692 is among the most infamous events in early American history; however, it was not the only such episode to occur in New England that year. <em>Escaping Salem</em> reconstructs the "other witch hunt" of 1692 that took place in Stamford, Connecticut. Concise and accessible, the book takes students on a revealing journey into the mental world of early America, shattering the stereotype of early New Englanders as quick to accuse and condemn. <br> Drawing on eyewitness testimony, Richard Godbeer tells the story of Kate Branch, a seventeen-year-old afflicted by strange visions and given to blood-chilling wails of pain and fright. Branch accused several women of bewitching her, two of whom were put on trial for witchcraft. <em>Escaping Salem</em> takes us inside the Connecticut courtroom and into the minds of the surprisingly skeptical Stamford townspeople. Were the pain and screaming due to natural or supernatural causes? Was Branch simply faking the symptoms? And if she was indeed bewitched, why believe her specific accusations, since her information came from demons who might well be lying? For the judges, Godbeer shows, the trial was a legal thicket. All agreed that witches posed a real and serious threat, but proving witchcraft (an invisible crime) in court was another matter. The court in Salem had become mired in controversy over its use of dubious evidence. In an intriguing chapter, Godbeer examines Magistrate Jonathan Selleck's notes on how to determine the guilt of someone accused of witchcraft, providing an illuminating look at what constituted proof of witchcraft at the time. The stakes were high--if found guilty, the two accused women would be hanged. <br> In the afterword, Godbeer explains how he used the trial evidence to build his narrative, offering an inside perspective on the historian's craft. Featuring maps, photos, and a selected bibliography, <em>Escaping Salem</em> is ideal for use in undergraduate U.S. survey courses. It can also be used for courses in colonial American history, culture, and religion; witchcraft in the early modern world; and crime and society in early America.<br></p><p>Richard Godbeer is at University of California at Riverside.<br>"<em>Escaping Salem</em> will engage every reader who has fallen under the spell of witchcraft's history in New England. But beware: still deeper enchantment awaits as Richard Godbeer unfolds his riveting tale of how ordinary men and women struggled to make sense of the wonders and terrors at work in their Connecticut village."--Christine Leigh Heyrman, <em>University of Delaware</em><p></p><br>"Richard Godbeer's <em>Escaping Salem</em> is a thoughtful and lively retelling of a 'forgotten' witchcraft case. The strong story line is nicely balanced with astute commentary on the background and context. Indeed Godbeer uses the case to open up a broad vista of early New England life at ground level. And, in doing so, he shows a balance of interests and concerns that differs significantly from the endlessly hyped (but somewhat atypical) picture of the 'Salem witch-craze' in exactly the same year."--John Demos, <em>Yale University</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Lines from a Mined Mind: The Words of John Trudell</h2><p><p><i>Lines from a Mined Mind</i> brings together lyrics and musings from the twenty-five-year recording career of John Trudell, an internationally acclaimed poet, musician, and leader of the American Indian Movement. More than a simple anthology, this collection goes deeper, revealing the incendiary intersection of music and activism.</p></p><p>John Trudell is an acclaimed poet, national recording artist, actor, and activist whose international following reflects the universal language of his words, work, and message. Trudell (Santee Sioux) was a spokesperson for the Indian of All Tribes occupation of Alcatraz Island from 1969 to 1971. He then worked with the American Indian Movement, serving as chairman from 1973 to 1979."...blends delicate lyricism with passionate political criticism and left me determined to hear Trudell perform the poetry as songs." --<i>Blogcritics, August 2, 2008</i></p><h2>A Study of Numbers: A Guide to the Constant Creation of the Universe</h2><p>We lack direct consciousness of Space and Time. We can know of them only indirectly by mass, force, and energy, and by the intermediary of phenomena such as may be tested by our five senses. Without direct awareness of Space or Time, human beings lack two &#x201c;senses&#x201d; necessary for the knowledge of all causes. From this imperfection, of which we are always being made aware, is born our need to simplify. Thus we reduce everything to fundamental properties, without paying any attention to the underlying universal organization, the effects of which are all around us. <br> <br>The result is that the science of numbers, the most wonderful guide to the constant creation of the universe, remains an enormous hypothesis so long as its use has not awakened in us the higher consciousness of a universal order. By deepened knowledge of things and their process of becoming, we must come to recognize Numbers as a truth, and to experience with our senses the living relation of a cause to an effect, this relation being truer and more real than the effect could ever be. <br> <br>Published in 1917 under the author's given name of Ren� Schwaller, <i>A Study of Numbers</i> is the first expression of the teachings we have come to associate with his later and better known name, R.A. Schwaller de Lubicz. It is a masterly account of the living, universal, qualitative, and casual reality of numbers. <br> <br>Starting from the irreducible one, Schwaller deals with the unfolding of creation through the cycles of polarization, ideation, and formation. Topics covered include: numbers, values, and relations; the disengagement of numbers; the harmonic basis of numbers; the development of values; and the establishment of harmony.</p><p>R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz (1887-1961) was one of the most important philosophers, mathematicians, and Egyptologists of this century. His elucidation of the temple at Luxor and his presentation of the Egyptian understanding of a special quality of innate consciousness form a bridge that links the sacred science of the Ancients to its rediscovery in our own time.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>How to Change Your Life: An Inspirational, Life-Changing Classic from the Ernest Holmes Library</h2><p>Ernest Holmes&#x2019;s rational, lucid explanation of why our thoughts have power will instruct readers on how they can change their lives by changing their thinking.

If readers are ready to positively jumpstart their lives, this is the book that can help them do it.</li></p><p>Ernest Holmes (1887-1960) was the founder of the Science of Mind philosophy and movement. Ernest Holmes&#39;s teachings are based on both Eastern and Western traditions, and the empirical laws of science and metaphysics. Science of Mind is a spiritual philosophy that people throughout the world have come to know as a positive, supportive approach to life. These ancient truths have kept pace with and proven their relevancy in today&#39;s global village and its expanding technology and warp-speed changes. Author of The Science of Mind, the seminal book on his teachings, Holmes also founded the monthly periodical, Science of Mind magazine, which has been in continuous monthly publication since 1927.Chapter One<br>Your Dreams Can Come True!<br><br> <p>Every human being thrills at the thought of having dreams come true! The idea means different things to different people. To you it may mean physical health: the ability to walk, run, play, to engage in activity. To me, it may mean abundance: money, a home, a car&#x2015;opulence. To another, dreams may involve education, or the ability to get along with people. Whatever your personal desires may be&#x2015;as long as they do not hurt yourself or someone else&#x2015;you have a right to attain them . . . <i>and you can.</i></p> <p>The ability to attain your goals&#x2015;to control your experiences and have them result in happiness, prosperity and success&#x2015;lies in your own mind and the way you use it. This means <i>you control your own experience</i>&#x2015;you are really in charge of your affairs and the way they are to develop.</p> <p>Let us sum it up this way: <i>My thought is in control of my experience, and I can direct my thinking.</i></p> <p>Read that again and then say it aloud. It is a most astounding statement and at first may even seem far-fetched. But because you are a thoughtful person with an open mind, ready to be shown what you may not at first understand&#x2015;even what does not seem entirely believable&#x2015;you will be willing to take that statement under consideration and hear the reasons for it. Certainly you do not have to believe it nor do you wish to until you have investigated it, heard the arguments in its favor, and observed whether or not it works for you after you have given it a fair trial. That is the way the intelligent mind approaches any new idea.</p><br> It Has to Make Sense<br><br> <p>No one can force a new belief upon another; no one has the right to attempt to do so. Only when we have made the appropriate intellectual inquiries and investigations for ourselves can we honestly decide whether to accept or reject what is presented to us. We are not going to allow ourselves to be coerced into anything of which our own good judgment does not approve. However, we cannot bring our good judgment to bear upon anything in fullest measure until we have been fair in our efforts to understand it and then faithful in our attempts to test it, to see <i>if it actually does work for us.</i></p> <p>If you were raised under Christian influences in the home and church, you will probably feel particularly sensitive about things that sound religious. You will be inclined to say, "I do not want anything to disturb my faith in God as an Overruling Providence and in Jesus as the Wayshower for men and women through his practical application of a loving, useful life and his triumphant conquest even over death itself."</p> <p>In response, the Science of Mind viewpoint suggests, "You are exactly right!"</p> <p>On the other hand, if you have lived apart from church activities and associations, or you have found them unfitted to your intellectual turn of mind and you want something on which you can base your thinking and faith, something that retains a clear concept of the orderly world of science in which natural law and order prevail, then we say, "That is a rational viewpoint and we believe you will find much that is of interest and value to you in the Science of Mind."</p> <p>Possibly, though, you may be just a busy man or woman who desires a wholesome, successful life and a sense of security. If you are going to give your attention to a new way of thinking, it will have to be something that makes sense and that you can apply in your everyday affairs, because you know it works!</p> <p>This is a realistic and reasonable attitude according to the Science of Mind viewpoint.</p><br> Something for You<br><br> <p>So . . . if an understanding of God meets your daily needs in a world of practical affairs, you want it. If some system of reasoning conforms to your keenest intellectual understanding and scientific knowledge, it is of interest to you. If you can find something which, for you, satisfies the deep inner hunger that lies in the hearts of all people (whether they ever acknowledge that hunger or not), you are just as eager as anyone else to find satisfaction. You have practical daily needs that must be met, intellectual demands that seek rational fulfillment, and sincere spiritual longings that have to be fulfilled. This is true of all persons. You are no exception.</p> <p>Now that we have a foundation for mutual understanding and a willingness to look into an exciting new way of thinking, let us go back to our earlier statement, enlarge it, and give it more careful consideration:</p> <blockquote><i>The ability to control my experiences and have them result in happiness, health, prosperity and success lies in my own mind and my use of it.</i></blockquote> <p></p><br> How Can This be So?<br><br> <p>Physical science has proved that everything can be scientifically reduced to one ultimate invisible Essence, something which cannot be directly contacted by the physical senses. It is therefore only reasonable to say that originally everything must have come from that Essence. According to your own way of thinking, different names are given to It: Energy, Principle, Universal Intelligence, Universal Mind, Consciousness, Spirit, God.</p> <p>For our purpose it does not particularly matter which of these names we use. Let us call It Mind. This probably has the broadest meaning for most of us, without too many limiting ideas connected with it.</p> <p>Scientists show us that Energy&#x2015;an aspect of Mind&#x2015;is interchangeable with Substance, and is everywhere: within us, around us, filling all space to the limitless reaches of the universe.</p> <p>Everything we can see, touch, taste, smell or contact in any physical way, we are told, is but some aspect of this Universal Energy or Mind, which has been channeled into specific and tangible form so that our senses become aware of It.</p> <p>For instance, on a summer day, entirely invisible vapor arises from the ocean and soars high in the sky. By contacting a different air temperature it becomes a cloud. If colder air still further condenses it, it turns into raindrops which help fill a lake. In winter a further change takes place and instead of raindrops there are snowflakes. Winter also changes the water of the lake to ice. In every instance we have only that original vapor, though it has taken forms of which our senses are aware. Similarly, Universal Mind, though always basically the same, appears in many different forms.</p><br> Mind is Everywhere<br><br>Einstein's famous equation, E=mc�, revolutionized and clarified much scientific thinking and at the same time cleared the way for the establishment of firmer foundations in philosophic and religious thought. In essence it means that energy and mass are one and the same, and are interchangeable. From our point of view this means that Mind&#x2015;God&#x2015;acting as Energy, becomes what we know as the physical world, according to law. <i>They are one and the same thing</i> (although God, being infinite, could never be depleted by what is created). We may reasonably declare that everything which will ever exist must also come from God. In fact there is nothing else out of which anything could be made. <p></p> <p>Mind is everywhere! After all, this is just the same as what we were taught to say in earliest childhood: "God is everywhere." That statement may not have meant much to us then, but now we know that this Universal Mind is everywhere . . . therefore It is within us!</p> <p>There can be no exception to that everywhereness. This gives us a key to the whole nature of Life and allows us to understand that not only our individual minds, but our bodies as well, are expressions and a part of Mind.</p><br> How You Can Utilize This New Awareness<br><br> <p>At the beginning of this world system of ours, there must have been nothing but the great Universal Mind&#x2015;God&#x2015;and out of Itself the tangible universe was formed.</p> <p>Those of us with Christian backgrounds were taught that God&#x2015;Universal Mind&#x2015;is omnipresent, and that we too were made in His image and likeness. So now we arrive at the conclusion that <i>we, at our level, possess a creativity similar to that of the Universal Mind.</i> We create in our experience whatever we choose: health, happiness, prosperity, employment&#x2015;any good thing we need&#x2015;through the process of our constructive thought, through which the unlimited creativity of Mind acts, giving form to our desired objective. The only way for us to constructively use the creativity of this invisible but everywhere-present Mind is <i>by means of our thought, faith and conviction</i>&#x2015;and nothing else!</p><br> You Have a Right to Create<br><br> <p>Today, the old idea of our being like God, the image-and-likeness concept, applies in a new and different but very important way. Since we are created of that which God is&#x2015;Mind&#x2015;we are made of and possess Godlike qualities, and we have the right and the ability to develop and use them. In fact, it is <i>necessary</i> for us to do this if we are to fully express the Life within us. Later we shall discuss these qualities, but just now we are interested in the creative aspect of our minds.</p> <p>What you <i>choose</i> is created for you out of and through the action of the One Universal Mind, which is everywhere and is accessible to you. You avail yourself of the Creative Action of Mind through <i>what you believe</i>! Perhaps you are not quite ready to accept this statement, but it is an interesting one, and well worth remembering.</p><br> How Can You Learn to Believe?<br><br> <p>First of all, you must remember that you can think whatever you please. No one can direct your thought processes. They are under your control.</p> <p>Someone may say, "You must think as a Republican," or "You have to be a Democrat in your thinking," or "My church's way of thinking is the only right one; you must think that way also," or "When you see a blackboard you have to think of it as being white." All of this is ridiculous. You may have to make your <i>actions</i> conform to what those in authority tell you, but they simply cannot control your <i>thinking</i>. You will go on thinking just as you want to. In that respect you are independent, no matter where you live or what your circumstances may be.</p> <p>If your thinking processes are really under your personal control, as you will agree they must be, and if thought is acted upon by the creativity of Mind to produce results according to your belief, then you surely do have the power to become the master of your own affairs and to bring to pass those good conditions you desire.</p> <p>This makes the <i>omnipresence of God</i> and the made in the image and <i>likeness of God</i> very practical and important ideas rather than abstract theological concepts. They can now become important truths which are part of your everyday life and are therefore of prime importance in all the practical aspects of living.</p> <p>Let us keep in mind that we not only have the God-given ability to do this kind of results-oriented thinking, but that we also have the <i>right</i> to do it. In connection with the God Power within you, there are many other aspects, but this one&#x2015;<i>the right and the ability and the power to "think creatively" so that you have more desirable experiences</i>&#x2015;is so impressive and so exceedingly important that it should be the basis of your life. Even though you may not fully accept or understand this statement yet, you can begin to put it into actual application for yourself. You can start right now to make it work!</p><br> He Changed His Life!<br><br> <p>The true story is told of a man in one of our Eastern cities who had been in one job for twenty-five years at a very mediocre salary. He had become extremely dissatisfied, wanted to get out of the rut, but didn't know how to do it. When he accepted a few simple but profound ideas like these, he began to realize that he had the right and the ability to declare better conditions for himself. In less than one month from the time he began to think in this way&#x2015;and to act accordingly&#x2015;his salary was increased to exactly three times what it had been before!</p> <p>When we get only a glimpse of the true nature of Mind&#x2015;the God-Power within us&#x2015;and use It, the results are truly amazing. Physically, financially, socially, intellectually and spiritually, it pays us to learn about and to use the principles of creative thinking. The student in a laboratory who tries a valid experiment and fails does not give up; he tries again and again until he proves it for himself. Shouldn't we be equally faithful in testing these scientific laws of Mind? Our personal welfare demands continued, faithful endeavor and experimentation.</p> <p>There is but One Mind; It is Omnipresent&#x2015;It is all there is. Everything visible and invisible is but a manifestation of this One Mind&#x2015;the result of Its Creative Action and the becoming of that which It creates. Because you are made in the image and likeness of God, you can use your mind, according to its nature, and by choice bring your good to you.</p><br> A Picture of Your Mind<br><br> <p>Now examine the diagram below [top right of screen] and think of it as representing the entire universe&#x2015;all that is. All of it is Mind.</p>For the sake of clarity we divide it into three sections, but it is all Mind! <p></p> <p>Part I, we may call Conscious Mind. Conscious Mind is that faculty with which you think and plan; with it you become aware of ideas, analyze, make decisions and carry on all mental processes. Let us think of it as being like the superintendent of a manufacturing plant, who thinks out what is to be done and gives instructions.</p> <p>Needless to say, however, nothing could be accomplished if some department did not take those instructions and carry them out. So, Part II is the aspect of Mind that obeys the directions of Part I. Think of it as the manufacturing plant itself, where the instructions are taken and worked out. From the Science of Mind viewpoint, we call this the Subjective Mind, the Law which acts and creates automatically according to instructions. It obeys the directions of Part I. Without Part I, it would be useless because it would lack instructions. Without Part II, Part I would be helpless for want of something to take directions and bring them to fulfillment. One part, therefore, is just as important as the other.</p> <p>Now look at Part III and realize that it is the only part of the universe you can experience&#x2015;see, touch or contact with your physical senses. It is the realm of tangible things and conditions. Here are the results of what was directed by Part I and carried out by Part II. Parts I and II instigate and carry out; Part III is the result, or effect.</p> <p>In the diagram, see the tiny portion marked "You."

He had served in the Pennsylvania state legislature, the U.S. House, and the U.S. Senate; he was Secretary of State and was even offered a seat on the Supreme Court. And yet, by every measure except his own, James Buchanan was a miserable failure as president, leaving office in disgrace.

To study Buchanan is to consider the implications of weak leadership in a time of national crisis.

The location of his birth, in a log cabin at the foot of North Mountain in the Alleghenies of southern Pennsylvania, was no accident. James Buchanan, Sr., had chosen Stony Batter, in Cove Gap, Franklin County, for its economic opportunities. His decision to live and later buy a trading post there eventually ensured his prosperity. An orphaned immigrant from County Donegal in northwest Ireland, twenty-two-year-old James Buchanan, Sr., had crossed the Atlantic Ocean in 1783, landing, like many others, in Philadelphia. He had made his way south and west through the rich and expensive farmland to live with an aunt and uncle in York County, Pennsylvania. The Buchanan clan was well known in Scotland and Ireland. Some members had moved from the barren hills of Scotland to Ireland to find a better life than the one they suffered during a period of starvation in the first part of the eighteenth century. Others migrated to protect their freedom of worship as Presbyterians from the assaults of kings and bishops of the Church of England. Ireland proved a way station, and they were soon on the move again, this time across the Atlantic to America. James Buchanan came with the advantages of education and ambition, though no money. Some of his neighbors later charged that he was a hard bargainer in his financial dealings. Inspired by the implacable doctrine of his Presbyterian faith that he must serve the Lord through hard work and stern duty in this world so that he might find a place in the next, he intended to get ahead. He expected his sons to do likewise. In fact Buchanan exemplified the Scotch-Irish of the so-called fourth migration to America, over a quarter of a million of whom arrived in Pennsylvania and Delaware in the eighteenth century. Some moved across the Susquehanna River into Maryland, Virginia, and Kentucky; others found opportunity in the rich agricultural state of Pennsylvania. James lived briefly in the town of York with a wealthy uncle who owned a tavern as well as two hundred acres of farmland. There he heard talk of the mountain gap picturesquely named Stony Batter <i>&#x2014;batter</i> is the Gaelic word for road. Five roads intersected there, and the number of horses in transit was sometimes so great as to require a large corral. In this tiny frontier community, there were often so many goods that the place seemed an emporium set in the wilderness. Four years after his arrival, in 1787, the year in which Americans wrote a Constitution and founded a new nation, James Buchanan bought the trading post in Cove Gap where earlier he had served as an apprentice to the owner. Here, for his broker&#x2019;s fee, he sold and bartered finished goods from Baltimore to settlers over the mountains. Then in 1788 he returned to York County to marry Elizabeth Speer, the daughter of a prosperous Scotch-Irish Presbyterian neighbor of his uncle. The next year George Washington took the first presidential oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution. And in what became a civic duty for Americans, citizens of the Republic were encouraged to marry and create families that would lay the foundations of national morality and progress. James was the second child, and oldest surviving son, of James and Elizabeth Speer Buchanan&#x2019;s large family of eleven children. An older sister died as an infant and, after James, five daughters arrived in the two-year pattern of fecund reproduction accomplished by American wives whose contraception ended when they stopped nursing their infants. Surrounded by younger sisters and an adoring mother who quoted Milton and Shakespeare to her children and engaged them in discussions about public affairs, James occupied a privileged but challenging position in his family. Years later in an unfinished autobiography, he described his father as having great force of character, but he credited his mother for any distinction that he had attained. &#x201c;She excited [my] ambition, by presenting &#x2026; in glowing colors men who had been useful to their country or their kind, as objects of imitation.&#x201d; Only when he turned thirteen did a younger brother survive. Eventually, three more brothers arrived. One was named George Washington Buchanan. The Republic&#x2019;s first president had become his mother&#x2019;s hero after he stayed in a nearby tavern during the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794&#x2014;95. Another was named Edward Younger after one of his mother&#x2019;s favorite English poets.1 In 1791 James Buchanan, Sr., had moved his family a few miles east&#x2014;from the rugged isolation of Stony Batter to a large farm near Mercersburg, Pennsylvania. A few years later, in 1794, as his financial circumstances continued to improve, Buchanan uprooted again, this time to a two-story brick home in Mercersburg, a small village populated by eighty families. There he established a store and became a prosperous merchant. At every opportunity he invested in real estate, and soon James Buchanan was the richest man in town. His wife had urged the move, anxious for the kind of gentility that was impossible on the frontier. Now the Buchanans joined Presbyterian Scotch-Irish neighbors named Campbell, McAllen, and McKinistry. In Mercersburg young James Buchanan attended school in town. At the Old Stone Academy, he studied the traditional classical curriculum of Latin and Greek, along with mathematics and literature and a little history&#x2014;the standard fare of the private academies of his generation. He was by all accounts, including his own, an excellent student. With enough money for the leverage of higher education, James Buchanan, Sr., sent his eldest son to Dickinson College in nearby Carlisle, Pennsylvania, where in 1807 he entered the junior class of fourteen students. Throughout his life as a testament to his formality, he had no nickname and was never junior, nor Jim, nor Jimmie except later to his political enemies, who called him &#x201c;Ten-Cents-a-Day Jimmie&#x201d; after he supported banking legislation considered unfavorable to workers. At the end of his life and behind his back he became &#x201c;Old Buck&#x201d; and &#x201c;Old Public Functionary,&#x201d; but he remains one of the few American presidents without a nickname. Like his father, he had no distinguishing middle name. The following year James Buchanan was expelled from Dickinson for bad behavior. Certainly the first half of the nineteenth century was a time of student rebellions in colleges throughout the United States, as riotous youths tested the authority of ministerial presidents and authoritarian institutions. At Yale there was the so-called Bread and Butter Riot; Harvard suffered the Great Rebellion of 1832; and Brown and Princeton endured student rebellions as well. During the disorganized early stages of Dickinson&#x2019;s history, James Buchanan joined a group of noisy classmates who, engaging in collective acts of unruliness, drank at nearby taverns, threw food in the dining room, broke windows, and kept the good citizens of Carlisle awake with their revelry. It is not the expulsion that is surprising, but rather Buchanan&#x2019;s insistence in his unfinished autobiography that he was not &#x201c;dissipated&#x201d; himself, but had drunk, roistered, and disturbed in order to be considered &#x201c;a clever and spirited youth&#x201d; by his fellow students. Popularity and the approval of others mattered to this young man, and would throughout his life. Only through the intervention of his Presbyterian rector with the trustees and the Presbyterian minister who was the head of the college was Buchanan reinstated. A year later he graduated with honors, though not the highest honors he thought he deserved. In doing so, he became one of a few thousand young men of his generation to graduate from college. But he never forgave Dickinson, describing the college as &#x201c;in a wretched condition&#x201d; when he attended and acknowledging years later that he felt &#x201c;little attachment to [his] Alma Mater.&#x201d; For the next stage of his life James Buchanan did not need a college degree, choosing the law as his profession&#x2014;not, as Woodrow Wilson once said, as the requisite stepping-stone for politics, but in order to earn a living. He moved to Lancaster, a town of eight thousand and at the time the capital of Pennsylvania. As all lawyers knew, the public business of the state and the associations with legislators offered many opportunities to find clients. And there was an even more compelling reason to move to Lancaster. Buchanan had been accepted as a student by the most eminent lawyer in town, James Hopkins. For the next two and a half years he served as an apprentice under the supervision of his well-known and respected mentor. In the custom of the day, Buchanan read and discussed the legal authorities, Joseph Chitty and William Blackstone, as well as the U.S. Codes, the Constitution, and the case law developing around it. In Buchanan&#x2019;s time there were only three law schools in the United States. Instead the law was a craft, casually handed down from one practitioner to another, who in turn, as Buchanan did after he set up his practice, opened their offices to other young aspirants. It was another seventy years before the American bar and institutions of higher learning created schools for specialized training. Still, Buchanan&#x2019;s self-discipline in learning his chosen profession&#x2019;s habits of orderly thinking and dependence on precedent significantly influenced his political principles and actions. As Buchanan promised throughout his life, he intended to follow the law and the Constitution. Buchanan gave &#x201c;severe application&#x201d; to his studies, becoming a familiar figure in the streets near the courthouse square where Hopkins kept his office. Here the young man walked about, transposing aloud principles of law into his own language and understanding. &#x201c;I studied the law and only the law,&#x201d; he declared. Later Buchanan acknowledged this process of speaking aloud as the method by which he learned how to give spontaneous political speeches, though in fact most of his speeches were prepared. In 1810, during his first year with Hopkins, his father delivered a stern advisory: &#x201c;Guard against temptations that may offer themselves,&#x201d; wrote the senior Buchanan to his son, &#x201c;knowing that without religion all other things are as trifles and will soon pass away &#x2026; . Go on with your studies and endeavor to be eminent in your profession.&#x201d; And though his father supported all his sons until they became lawyers or clergymen, he informed his eldest son, whom he held to the highest standards of paternal expectation, &#x201c;[I have suffered] privation in giving you a good education [which] will be compensated by the station in society you will occupy.&#x201d;2 Buchanan inherited his lifelong caution from his father. He lacked the sanguine optimism of successful political leaders, who focus on hopeful future solutions for current problems. The aphorisms that shaped his life were grim: &#x201c;It is the destiny of man to learn that evil treads closely on the footsteps of good&#x201d;; &#x201c;Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.&#x201d; And while he was considered a good conversationalist, he was never a man of humor. Soon he established himself as a rising star among Lancaster&#x2019;s twenty-six lawyers, most of whom had to scavenge for clients. By 1812 the city fathers of Harrisburg, in the opinion of those in Lancaster, had stolen the state capital away from a town that was still the largest inland community in the United States. With ambitions as lofty as those of the Buchanan family, Lancaster had expected to be the capital of the United States. Some lawyers quickly uprooted and moved to Harrisburg, Philadelphia, or the growing community of Pittsburgh. But Lancaster remained Buchanan&#x2019;s home for the rest of his life. After he registered with a notary and passed an informal oral exam given by a committee of the court in that casual arrangement marking the legal accreditation system for this generation, he was accepted into the Pennsylvania bar. A stern teacher, Buchanan now told his own young law apprentices to give up dissipation and bow to his control or face dismissal. His income rose rapidly from less than $1,000 in 1813, the first full year of his practice, to a substantial $11,297 in 1821 (approximately $175,000 today), the year he left Lancaster for Washington as a U.S. congressman. The law was hard work. Buchanan once described the practice that took him to several adjacent counties as &#x201c;extensive, laborious, and lucrative. It increased rapidly.&#x201d; He was a general-practice lawyer in the Second Judicial District who argued cases in the dusty courthouses of southern Pennsylvania&#x2014;a jack-of-all-trades who could write wills and contracts, argue guardianship cases for orphans, and litigate property claims. For an ambitious young man, his legal career also had the advantage of putting him in touch with the state&#x2019;s political leaders. Even as a neophyte, James Buchanan sought high-profile cases that brought prominence, more clients, and larger fees in a circular process that made him, before he was thirty-five, one of the best-known lawyers in southern Pennsylvania. His prudent money management, limited expenses, and adroit land and building investments around Lancaster rapidly made him a prosperous capitalist, worth over $300,000 (nearly $5 million in today&#x2019;s currency) by the time he died, and that after nearly forty-five years in low-paid public service. No doubt with the help of Hopkins, whose statewide reputation guaranteed an overflow of clients, Buchanan emerged as the counsel of choice for several prominent politicians. One colleague described his legal style as straightforward, unimaginative, and tenacious. When he was twenty-four years old, with only three years&#x2019; experience, Buchanan defended Judge Walter Franklin in the latter&#x2019;s impeachment trial before the Pennsylvania state senate. A member of the court of common pleas, Judge Franklin had ruled in a classic states&#x2019;-rights-versus-federal-government controversy that once a militia was nationalized, Pennsylvania&#x2019;s authority over a refusant ended. Accordingly the state could not fine a citizen of Lancaster who had declined to serve in the War of 1812. At a time in American legal history when the distinction between judicial error and impeachable offense rested on party prejudice, judges became hostages for decisions that did not suit the populace. Buchanan, at the time a member of the Federalist party, argued that Judge Franklin had committed no crime or misdemeanor. Franklin might have misjudged the issue, and certainly he had made an unpopular ruling. In his winning argument before the Pennsylvania senate, Buchanan held that only judicial crimes and malfeasance amounted to impeachable offenses. Outside of court, Buchanan attended to the social necessities required for an ambitious young lawyer on the rise&#x2014;joining fraternal associations where he met the leaders of the Lancaster community. He became a Mason and later chief master of his lodge; he was a manager for a society ball held in the White Horse Inn, and, most important for his political future, he served as president of the Washington Association, an organization of local Federalists. Like his father, James Buchanan supported that party&#x2019;s program of nationally subsidized internal improvements, protective tariffs, and a U.S. Bank. Soon he was a sought-after speaker who intrepidly&#x2014;for it was wartime&#x2014;criticized President James Madison&#x2019;s leadership during the War of 1812. Later, when he was accused of taking positions hostile to those of the Democratic party, Buchanan explained that he had simply followed his father into the Federalists. Buchanan could make his case against Madison and the War of 1812 with credibility. He had volunteered for a few weeks in a Lancaster company of young men who had no official status as members of the organized...</p><h2>The Irrational Season (The Crosswicks Journal, Book 3)</h2><p>This journal follows the church year from Advent to Advent, reflecting on its seasons and spiritual rhythms reflected in the life of the church and the author&#39;s own life.</p><p>Madeline L&#39;Engle, the popular author of many books for children and adults, has interspersed her writing and teaching career with raising three children, maintaining an apartment in New York and a farmhouse of charming confusion which is called &#34;Crosswicks.&#34;</p><h2>The Gambler: How Penniless Dropout Kirk Kerkorian Became the Greatest Deal Maker in Capitalist History</h2><p><p><strong>NATIONAL BESTSELLER</strong> </p><p><strong>&#x201c;Offers an entertaining look at Kerkorian&#x2019;s outsize life... an interesting portrait of a billionaire.&#x201d;</strong><strong> &#x2013; <em>Wall Street Journal</em></strong> </p><p>The rags-to-riches story of one of America&#x2019;s wealthiest and least-known financial giants, self-made billionaire Kirk Kerkorian&#x2014;the daring aviator, movie mogul, risk-taker, and business tycoon who transformed Las Vegas and Hollywood to become one of the leading financiers in American business.</p><p>Kerkorian combined the courage of a World War II pilot, the fortitude of a scrappy boxer, the cunning of an inscrutable poker player and an unmatched genius for making deals.

She is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Magical Bakery Mysteries, including <i>Spells and Scones</i>, <i>Magic and Macaroons</i>,<i> </i>and <i>Some Enchanted �clair.</i> Writing as Bailey Cattrell, she is also the author of the Enchanted Garden Mysteries, which began with <i>Daisies for Innocence</i>.Chapter 1<br><br> The bleat of a boat horn drifted from the river to mingle with the sounds of the Savannah waterfront. Tourists and locals strolled along the brick and tabby sidewalks. A pack of kids ran by, their laughter sparkling through the air. The intense aromas of she-crab soup, garlic, and onions drifted from Huey's Southern Caf�. Moments later, the sugary fragrance of custom-made candies outside River Street Sweets filled my nose. If I hadn't just finished off our celebratory meal at Vic's with an indulgent serving of sweet potato cr �me br�l�e, I might have dragged my companions inside for a piece of salted fudge.<br><br> "I can't believe it's already been two years," Aunt Lucy said. She and Uncle Ben were walking ahead of Declan and me, their arms twined around each other's waists.<br><br> Ben smiled and drew her closer. "The time certainly has flown by."<br><br> She laid her head against his shoulder, and a long tendril of gray-blond hair escaped from its messy bun to curl against the back of her neck. Hand in hand, Declan and I followed at a leisurely pace.<br><br> We passed a man strumming a guitar and crooning "Mr. Tambourine Man," occasionally blowing into the harmonica suspended by a metal bracket in front of his face. A bearded gentleman dropped a few dollars into the guitar case at his feet, and they exchanged nods. A toddler in shorts and a chocolate-stained T-shirt ran by at an impressive speed, his harassed-looking mother barreling after him, half bent over with her arms spread wide to sweep him up. Streaks of color pinked the western sky as the sun dipped toward the horizon.<br><br> A dragonfly flitted in front of us. Declan squeezed my fingers as the iridescent beauty dodged the watchful gaze of a gull on a nearby light post and zoomed toward the Savannah River. Our steps slowed as we both took note of its path.<br><br> "Is that one of yours?" he murmured.<br><br> I shrugged. "There's just the one. Probably on the hunt for supper."<br><br> "Seems a bit late in the day," he answered with mild skepticism.<br><br> "Mm. More mosquitoes out now, though."<br><br> Aunt Lucy noticed the mosquito hawk as well and shot me a conspiratorial look over her shoulder. She and Declan both knew dragonflies were my witch's totem, a kind of metaphysical tap on the shoulder that told me to pay attention to whatever was going on.<br><br> But I was feeling happy and lazy, my skin caressed by the soft April air, my belly full of good food, and the evening blessed with the company of some of my favorite people in the world. At the moment, I wasn't interested in taps on the shoulder-metaphysical or otherwise-calling me to action. Still, I couldn't help a quick glance around, intuitively probing our surroundings. Nothing along Rousakis Plaza appeared amiss, and I dismissed the winged visitor as a coincidence.<br><br> The four of us were taking our time returning from a thoroughly decadent supper at Vic's on the River. We'd been celebrating the second anniversary of the grand opening of the Honeybee Bakery, as well as the success our enterprise had enjoyed during the past two years. There had been a few low points, of course. Heck, before we'd even managed to open the doors to the public, Uncle Ben had been the main suspect in the murder of crotchety old Mavis Templeton. Nevertheless, I would be forever grateful that he and my aunt had talked me into quitting my boring, poorly paid position as an assistant bakery manager in downtown Akron to move to Georgia. Ben had just retired as Savannah's fire chief, and their brainstorm of teaming up with me to start the Honeybee had saved my sanity. Plus, getting far away from the guy who had dumped me mere days before our wedding had seriously saved my pride.<br><br> Of course, I'd learned Lucy had another reason for luring me south. Out of the blue, she'd sprung the news that she and I were both hedgewitches. Magic in the kitchen, she'd said. A natural green thumb. Some call those of us with a gift for cooking and garden spells "green witches." Whatever moniker you choose, our kind has been helping and healing for centuries by tapping into the natural magic inherent in herbs, spices, and food.<br><br> It had taken a little convincing, though. Imagine having someone you love suddenly dump that bombshell on you one afternoon over a cup of tea. Lucy had assured me hedgewitchery was a family heritage my mother had long hidden from me. At first, I'd scoffed and rolled my eyes at my hemp-wearing hippie aunt's airy-fairy notion. I mean, who wouldn't? However, I'd eventually realized that it explained an awful lot about my childhood-and my adulthood, for that matter-and came to accept my magical gifts.<br><br> I brought my thoughts back to the present. Near the Anchor Monument, an elderly couple held hands and gazed out toward the water. Suddenly, the woman leaned in and whispered something into the man's ear, and he smiled. They had an aura about them that told me they'd been together for most of their lives, probably had children and grandchildren and maybe even great-grandchildren. Still, they could make each other smile, still wanted to hold hands.<br><br> I glanced up at Declan's face, savoring his ice-blue eyes beneath wavy dark hair. A half grin softened the solid planes of his cheekbones and jaw. However, his attention had been snagged by something down toward the River Street Market Place, and he missed the question in my eyes. Would we be like that older couple in fifty years? Would we have children and grandchildren, too? We'd been engaged for a little more than four months but hadn't set a date for the wedding yet. He'd made only a few mild comments, but I could sense he was getting impatient. From the beginning, Declan had been the one pushing our relationship to the next level.<br><br> I knew he wasn't at all like Andrew, my erstwhile fianc� of three years ago. He'd never leave me at the altar. Still, how could I know we'd make it together in the long run? How could anyone know? Then my gaze cut to Lucy and Ben, and I had my answer. His gentle brown eyes were full of affection as they met hers. They'd met later in life and been married thirteen years. I couldn't imagine the way they looked at each other ever changing, not if they lived to be a hundred. The chemistry between them was undeniable, the roots of their connection tangled deep and strong.<br><br> Declan and I had been through quite a bit in the year and a half we'd been together. It had been touch and go a couple of times-especially after an incident when I'd nearly killed him with magic. It had been an accident, but still . . . it could have broken us. Yet in the end it had helped to strengthen our bond.<br><br> The anxiety that had begun to rise within me quieted.<br><br> As we continued to walk, I disengaged my hand from Declan's and slid it around his waist. He grinned down at me absently, then looked at the juggler we were approaching. As we watched, he touched a flame to four torches and began tossing them into the air. The spectacle lent a dramatic touch to the festive atmosphere. Ben's and Declan's eyes lit up in appreciation, drawn to the flames as only those of a former fire chief and a current firefighter would be.<br><br> Ben either hadn't noticed the dragonfly or didn't care. Unlike Lucy and me, my uncle wasn't particularly interested in such small magical details. He knew we were witches, of course, and fully supported his wife, his niece, and the other members of our informal coven, the spellbook club. Declan had come around, too, especially after a s�ance in which he discovered he had his own, er . . . gift.<br><br> We passed the juggler. A group of children was gathered around a ventriloquist with a wooden dummy on his knee, their mouths open with delight as the dummy appeared to speak of its own accord. The man and his puppet sported the same dark-framed glasses and black hair, the puppet a mirror of its handler.<br><br> "What's brown and sticky?" the ventriloquist asked.<br><br> Murmurs from the kids, and a few parents exchanged looks of mild alarm.<br><br> "A stick!" cracked the dummy in a high voice.<br><br> Everyone laughed, and we kept walking.<br><br> A redheaded man on a unicycle pedaled among the buskers and spectators in complicated turns and spirals, stopping on a dime and then veering off again. Booths and tables boasted everything from crafts and food products to kitschy souvenirs and funky clothing.<br><br> About fifty feet away, a woman sat beneath an arching canopy of draperies. The high back of her chair was elaborately carved and rose a foot above her head, giving the impression of a throne. Her silver braid was coiled on the crown of her head. A small black fedora tied with a scarlet scarf perched on top of the braid. Her long red skirt pooled on the patterned carpet beneath her feet, and silver rings flashed from every finger. Thick eyeliner gave her the look of a wise cat, peering over her tiny half-glasses at the woman sitting across the table from her.<br><br> "Katie, look. That's Orla." Lucy turned to me. "She hasn't come into the bakery for ages."<br><br> "Maybe she's on a diet," I said. "And I rather suspect that at the moment she's not the Orla Black we know." I tipped my head to the side. I'd never seen our friend in her full fortune-telling regalia.<br><br> My aunt nodded. "This is certainly a different look for her. I wonder if she's almost finished with this client."<br><br> "Client or mark?" Ben murmured as he pushed his&nbsp; glasses up the bridge of his nose. Even though he witnessed us practicing our mild-mannered magic every day, his eyes were narrowed with skepticism, and his lips pressed together above his short beard.<br><br> "Hush, dear," Lucy said. "Orla's the real deal."<br><br> A lush velvet cloth the color of the night sky covered the round table in front of the fortune-teller. On it sat a deck of oversized tarot cards and a plain glass sphere on a black stand. Instinctively, I sent out a questioning tendril of intuition and felt an oh-so-subtle current of real power coming from the woman. That wasn't surprising, really, since magic is around us every day if we pause to look for it. However, the elaborate costume and stereotypical trappings seemed a little over-the-top.<br><br> Or are they stereotypical? I chided myself. Spellbook club member Jaida French was an expert in all things tarot, and Mimsey Carmichael's pink quartz shew stone had come in handy for our group more than once.<br><br> "We should get back to the bakery," Ben said with a pointed glance at his watch.<br><br> Reluctantly, I began to follow him toward the stairs that led up to Bay Street.<br><br> Suddenly the air was a-whir with the lacy wings of a hundred dragonflies. I heard Declan suck in his breath, and a pang of anticipation arrowed through my sternum as I stopped and turned back toward Orla.<br><br> "Katie," Ben said, "what are you . . ."<br><br> He trailed off when Lucy gently squeezed his shoulder. Her eyes followed the phalanx of dragonflies as they gathered above the fortune-teller's canopy, hovered in a tight knot, and then exploded in every direction like a benevolent bomb.<br><br> I quickly sidled back, drawing Declan with me. We watched as Orla shoved the crystal ball to the side, placed her hands palms up in the center of the table, and nodded for the woman who sat in the rickety metal chair across from her to grasp them with her own. After a moment's hesitation, she did. She flinched as their skin touched, and she drew back. Then she took a deep breath and reached for the fortune-teller's fingers again.<br><br> The client looked to be a decade or so older than me, so about forty. Her cream-colored suit and expensive shoes coupled with the blond chignon and haughty expression made her look like an unlikely personality to seek the advice of a sidewalk seer. Still, I knew better than to judge anyone by her looks when it came to magic or any of its ancillaries. No one in the spellbook club looked like a "witch," except perhaps Bianca Devereaux, with her long black hair and piercing green eyes.<br><br> We had drawn close enough that I could hear the lilt of Orla's murmuring voice, but not the words. However, the look on the other woman's face had gone from stony to frightened.<br><br> Suddenly, the blonde swept the deck of cards off the table and stood. "How dare you say that to me?" she growled. Her hand came up, and she shook her finger in Orla's face. "You are a disgrace. A sad, pathetic disgrace. A complete and utter fraud. And you ask for money for telling people this kind of nonsense? Unconscionable!" Her eyes blazed with anger, but even from where Declan and I stood thirty feet away, I could see the anguish behind her anger.<br><br> "Wow," Declan murmured into my ear. "I've never heard anyone actually use that word out loud before."<br><br> I nudged him to be quiet.<br><br> "Madam." Orla slowly rose to her feet with great dignity. "I'm sorry you didn't like what you heard. However, you did insist that I tell you the truth. It is my gift and my curse that I am able to do so."<br><br> "Truth! Ha! I bet what you're doing is illegal. In fact, I'm going to contact the authorities-" She stopped midsentence as a man strode across the brick walk toward her. It was the ventriloquist whom we'd seen earlier, sans dummy. His face, so cheerful when he'd been joking with the kids, was now mottled with fury.<br><br> Blanching, Orla's client backed away, then turned and fled. I was surprised at how fast she was able to make her way up the stairway to Bay Street in those heels.<br><br> "Hey!" the man yelled after her. "Stop! You haven't paid the fee!"<br><br> He appeared poised to run after her, but Orla stopped him with a hand on his arm. "Let it go, Taber."<br><br> "But-" He shrugged off her hand and turned toward her. "Mother, are you all right?"<br><br> Mother?<br><br> She snorted. "Of course. You worry too much."<br><br> He regarded her in silence for a few seconds. "Perhaps. Still, you can't allow your clients to get away without paying. I'm only trying to help."<br><br> Orla tore off her fedora, which unfastened the braid on top of her head. As it uncoiled, she absently flipped it over her shoulder. That simple act transformed her from being a mysterious reader of fortunes to plain old Orla Black, who loved the peach fritters at the Honeybee Bakery.</p><h2>Stony the Road We Trod: African American Biblical Interpretation</h2><p>Stony the Road We Trod: African American Biblical Interpretation [Paperback] ...</p><p>A hallmark of American black religion is its distinctive use of the Bible in creating community, resisting oppression, and fomenting social change.This is a splendid collection of 11 essays by African American biblical scholars; the introduction puts the essays, and the consultation out of which they grew, into context.

It was one of the worst human disasters in history.The bodies were sparsely covered that the dogs dragged them forth and devoured themAnd believing it to be the end of the world, no one wept for the dead, for all expected to die. Agnolo di Turo, Siena, 1348In just over a thousand days from 1347 to 1351 the &#39;Black Death&#39; travelled across medieval Europe killing thirty per cent of its population. It was a catastrophe that touched the lives of every individual on the continent. The deadly Y. Pestis virus entered Europe in October 1347 by Genoese galley at Messina, Sicily. In the spring of 1348 it was devastating the cities of central Italy, by June 1348 it had reached France and Spain, and by August England. At St Marys, Ashwell, Hertfordshire, an anonymous hand carved the following inscription for 1349: Wretched, terrible, destructive year, the remnants of the people alone remain.According to the Foster scale, a kind of Richter scale of human disaster, the plague of 1347-51 is the second worst catastrophe in recorded history. Only World War II produced more death, physical damage, and emotional suffering. Defence analysts use it as the measure of thermonuclear war in geographical extent, abruptness and casualties.In The Great Mortality John Kelly retraces the journey of the Black Death using original source material diary fragments, letters and manuscripts. It is the devastating portrait of a continent gripped by an epidemic, but also a very personal story, narrated by the individuals whose lives were touched by it.</p><p>John Kelly has been writing about science, medicine and human behaviour for more than 20 years, and has an MA in European history from New York University. He is the author of nine previous books. He lives in New York.&#39;There has never been a better researched, better written or more engaging account of the worst epidemic the world has ever known than this: the countless controversies that have raged around the origins and the true nature of this terrible period in human history seem now all to have been settled by the gimlet accuracy of John Kelly&#39;s superb and fascinating book.&#39; Simon Winchester</p><h2>Shop Drawings for Greene &amp; Greene Furniture: 23 American Arts and Crafts Masterpieces (Fox Chapel Publishing)</h2><p><p>23 Projects for every room in the home!

Cynthia Bishop as the narrator and Erika Lustig as Princess Ani give especially good performances in this full-cast production, and musical cues add a nice accompaniment. The only distraction is the "voice" given to inanimate objects, such as the wind, which overstretches the plot. L.H. � AudioFile 2006, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>The Body Project: An Intimate History of American Girls</h2><p>A hundred years ago, women were lacing themselves into corsets and teaching their daughters to do the same. The ideal of the day, however, was inner beauty: a focus on good deeds and a pure heart. Today American women have more social choices and personal freedom than ever before. But fifty-three percent of our girls are dissatisfied with their bodies by the age of thirteen, and many begin a pattern of weight obsession and dieting as early as eight or nine. Why?<br><br>In <i>The Body Project</i>, historian Joan Jacobs Brumberg answers this question, drawing on diary excerpts and media images from 1830 to the present. Tracing girls' attitudes toward topics ranging from breast size and menstruation to hair, clothing, and cosmetics, she exposes the shift from the Victorian concern with character to our modern focus on outward appearance&#x2014;in particular, the desire to be model-thin and sexy. Compassionate, insightful, and gracefully written, <i>The Body Project</i> explores the gains and losses adolescent girls have inherited since they shed the corset and the ideal of virginity for a new world of sexual freedom and consumerism&#x2014;a world in which the body is their primary project.</p><p>Adolescent girls today face the issues girls have always faced: "Who am I?" and "Who do I want to be?" Unfortunately their answers, now more than ever before, revolve around the body rather than the mind, heart, or soul. "The body is at the heart of the crisis that [Carol] Gilligan, [Mary] Pipher, and others describe.... The fact that American girls now make the body their central project is not an accident or a curiosity," writes Brumberg, "it is a symptom of historical changes that are only now beginning to be understood." The historical photos, thorough research, and political even-handedness make this a book of worth and sincerity. <i>The Body Project</i> is also comforting for women, adolescents, parents, lesbians, and male lovers of women--helping us sort out the roots of female insecurities, obsessions, and angst.JOAN JACOBS BRUMBERG on <b>The Body Project</b>:<p>America's adolescent girls are in crisis. Growing up in<br> a female body is more difficult today than ever before<br> because girls' bodies have changed and so has<br> American society. Menstruation and sexual activity<br> begin much earlier and there is also much greater<br> emphasis on the body as a way of defining the self.<br> Using intimate materials drawn from the unpublished<br> diaries of American girls, The Body Project provides<br> a lively and engaging story of how growing up as a girl<br> has changed over the past one hundred years, and why<br> the pressures on girls are now so intense. </p><p> Girls today grow up believing that "good looks"--rather<br> than "good works"--are the highest form of female<br> perfection. In the past, greater maternal involvment and<br> more single sex groups, such as the Girl Scouts,<br> supported the whole girl, placing greater emphasis on<br> internal rather than external qualities. But in the<br> twentieth century, that "protective umbrella"<br> disappeared, popular culture became more powerful,<br> and expectations about physical perfection increased<br> so that American girls came to define themselves more<br> and more through their bodies. </p><p> Today, the body has become most girls' primary<br> project, creating a degree of self-consciousness and<br> dissatisfaction that is pervasive and dangerous,<br> leading to the social and emotional problems identified<br> by Carol Gilligan, Mary Pipher, and Peggy Orenstein.<br> For everyone concerned with adolescent girls--parents,<br> teachers, librarians, physicians, nurses, and mental<br> health professionals--The Body Project is a "must"<br> read because it puts so many contemporary<br> adolescent issues in historical perspective. </p><p> A fascinating photo essay comprised of photographs,<br> advertisements and postcards shows how girls and<br> their bodies have changed since the nineteenth<br> century. From corsets to body piercing, the book<br> demonstrates how the preoccupation with the body has<br> intensified and why adolescent girls and their bodies<br> have born the brunt of social change in the twentieth<br> century. </p><p> Although The Body Project acknowledges a problem,<br> it is still an entertaining read because it evokes so<br> many memories in the lives of girls and<br> women--particularly personal milestones such as first<br> periods, pimples, training bras, first dates, and sexual<br> awakening. The Body Project is perfect for generating<br> mother-daughter dialogue, and it is remarkable for its<br> insight about what adolescent girls have gained and<br> lost as American women shed the corset and the ideal<br> of virginity for a new world of dieting and body<br> sculpting, sexual freedom and self expression."<br> <br> --Joan Jacobs Brumberg</p></p><h2>The Art of Contrary Thinking</h2><p><i>Distributed by the University of Nebraska Press for Caxton Press</i><br>"When everybody thinks alike, everyone is likely to be wrong."&nbsp; The ten words quoted above are, according to Humphrey B. Neill, a potent factor behind the economic booms and busts that blight our civilization.&nbsp; The "Mississippi Bubble", Holland's incredible "Tulipmania" and the New York stock market crash of 1929 are historic examples of disasters magnified and hastened by the pressure of mass opinion.&nbsp; Neill describes these occurrences in detail and tells the reader how to avoid and recognize the dangers that "following the pack" can pose to the discerning investor.</p><p>Humphrey B. Neill (1977) spent his life observing and writing about the folly of group thinking that is all too prevalent throughout our society.&nbsp;</p><h2>Core Transformation: Reaching the Wellspring Within</h2><p>Imagine your limitations becoming a doorway to states often called "Inner Peace," "Joy," "Love," or "Oneness." Core Transformation meets the deepest strivings of our times: to heal our problems and develop spiritually. "Oneness and Being," the goal of most psycho-spiritual approaches, is no longer a mysterious ideal. Core Transformation makes it tangible, even inevitable. The simple ten-step process in this book offers a gentle, compassionate way to melt limitations rather than fight them. People have used CT to heal relationships, "problem" emotions such as anger or jealousy, overcome anxiety or depression, stop smoking, improve health, and more. Whatever your life issues are, discover how they can actually become the source of an inner gift.<b>Reviews for Core Transformation:</b>"Core Transformation offers a profound way to touch the depths of our own soulfulness. I had an immediate and deep experience of self-love with it." --John Bradshaw, author, Creating Love"One of the most important works I have come across in any field, Core Transformation should be adopted as the principal therapy by every therapist in the country, understood and practiced by everyone in the helping and legal professions, as well as parents and teachers. I stand in awe at the simplicity, clarity and directness of a work of such magnitude, and will do all I can to promote it." --Joseph Chilton Pearce, author, The Crack in the Cosmic Egg, The Magical Child, Evolution's End"I am astounded. Suddenly we have a bridge from psychopathology (or plain human problems) to enlightenment. There it stands, every beam in place and traffic already passing over it. I know therapist types will make ready use of it, and I hope religions will embrace the profound implications of this fine new bridge into their territory." --Wilson Van Dusen, Ph.D, former Chief Psychologist at Mendocino State Hospital, CA"Core Transformation is a brilliant book about a brilliant process. It quickly takes you to the core of your being. What a powerful and simple gift! I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to achieve higher states of love, peace and joy!"--Jack Canfield, President, Self Esteem Seminars, author, Chicken Soup for the Soul"The way to a man and woman s heart is through this book. Core Transformation will help you turn your limitations inside out, enabling you to experience yourself in a way you never dreamed possible." --Michele Weiner-Davis, author, Divorce Busting"Core Transformation takes us beyond assumed boundaries, into the virgin territories of the self-a place of greater courage and love, into the well-spring of authenticity, the core of being." --Dan Millman, author, The Way of the Peaceful Warrior and The Life You Were Born to Live"This book will take you there. Compassionately, clearly and interestingly written, with just the right balance of idea and procedure. There is no limit to the good Core Transformation could end up doing." --Huth Prather, author, Notes to Myself"This book will help you make changes that lead directly to increased personal effectiveness. I recommend Core Transformation to anyone in business who wants to improve results." --Dan Thomas, Ph.D., former Professor, Harvard and Stanford Business Schools; author of Business Sense</p><p>In this book you will be invited to identify the behaviors, feelings and responses you like least in yourself, and use them to take yourself on a remarkably healing and uplifting personal journey within, to the depths of your beingness. This journey is called the Core Transformation Process. <p>The material presented in this book is a breakthrough for me both personally and professionally, and I believe it is a breakthrough in the field of personal growth and psychology. As I explored and developed the Core Transformation Process with clients and with myself, I began to have a sense of awe and reverence for what I witnessed. Powerfully transforming states of consciousness, which I call Core States, were naturally emerging. These states seemed to be identical to the states of consciousness many people strive for in spiritual traditions, described as transcendent or spiritual experiences. Through doing the Core Transformation Process these states became more than a temporary high--they became the basis for living from a new "center." </p><p>The way these experiences emerged was surprising and unexpected. I had no intention of developing a process with spiritual overtones. My goal was to develop a process that went deep enough to the core of our experience to be effective with everything from seemingly trivial problems to our biggest life issues. I wanted something that went deeper than what I had known Before--both for myself and for my clients. </p><p>In this search I gave myself the challenge of working with people who had some major limitation they hadn't been able to change. The issues they dealt with varied widely from chronic pain, abuse, bulimia, rage, sexual difficulties, codependency, to the man who felt he always held himself back from living his full potential. </p><p>In seeking to find what would transform these major life issues I stumbled upon a process that went far beyond my original goals. Most of the people I took through it got the results they wanted in their lives--either complete changes or significant movement in the direction they desired. But beyond that, they wrote me cards and letters telling me things like, "It's a miracle," or, "Everything has changed." One person who didn't get what he had specifically asked for said, "I got something better; something wonderful is happening that's hard to put into words." </p><p>Discovering these incredibly powerful Core States at the center of every inner part in myself and others has certainly transformed my sense of the spiritual nature within each of us. This spiritual nature is not a belief system, it is an experience, and I want to acknowledge that you may prefer to describe your experience in other terms. You do not need to have a spiritual belief to benefit from the Core Transformation Process. When we do this process with individual clients, or in workshops, we often do not talk about what kind of experience to expect. You will get equally strong results whether you describe your experience as spiritual, or in other terms that fit better for you. </p><p>...As you do these exercises, be gentle and patient with yourself. As you read each step, we will be there with you, guiding you in what may be the kindest thing you have done for yourself in some time. The process is simple and straightforward. First we will assist you in welcoming the parts of yourself that you want to change--they are about to become your strongest and most helpful allies.</p>Connirae Andreas, Ph.D., has been a leader for three decades in the field of personal development through her teaching and writing.

In Salem, Massachusetts, witches have been found, and widespread fear and panic reign mere miles from Abigail's home of Andover. When two girls are brought from Salem to identify witches in Andover, suspicion sweeps the town as well-respected members of the community are accused of witchcraft. It isn't long before chaos consumes Andover, and the Faulkners find themselves in the center of it all when friend turns themselves in the center of it all when friend turns against friend, neighbor against neighbor, in a desperate fight for the truth. At the heart of this gripping story are Abigail and her sister, Dorothy, who together must find a way to persevere during a period marked by terror, adversity, and ignorance. <br> Told from Abigail's point of view and based on actual events in the author's own family histoy, <i>The Sacrifice</i> offers a unique perspective of the Salem witch trials by delving into the devestating effects the trials had not just in Salem but throughout Massachusetts.</p><p><b>Kathleen Benner Duble</b> is the author of such books as Hearts of Iron, The Sacrifice, Bridging Beyond, and Pilot Mom. She lives in Boxford, Massachusetts with her family.&nbsp; You can visit her online at&nbsp;www.kathleenduble.com.Grade 4-8&#x2013;Set in Andover in the late 17th century, this novel describes one family's experiences with the Salem witchcraft hysteria. As the story opens, 10-year-old Abigail is sitting in the stocks wearing a sign that says Sinner. She constantly questions the limits placed on her by her community and does not regret her crime&#x2013;racing her male cousin, which is considered inappropriate for girls. Expecting her preacher grandfather to condemn her actions from the pulpit on Sunday, she is surprised when he speaks instead on bearing false witness&#x2013;comments targeted to those who were accusing others of being witches. The madness spreads and before long, Abigail's Aunt Elizabeth is charged and jailed. Eventually, Abigail and her sister are also denounced and imprisoned, sharing her filthy, rat-infested cell. After their aunt dies, the girls' pregnant mother, believing that her condition will protect her, asks her daughters to claim that she is really the witch so that she can take their place in jail. In the end, Abigail speaks up about the evil of false accusations and helps bring the insanity to an end. Based in part on family history, Duble's narrative clearly captures the sweeping effects of community fear and shows how one youngster's bravery can bring about change. Well written with accessible language, this book will appeal to a wide range of readers.<i>&#x2013;Jane G.

He first found his true voice in the epigrams and odes he wrote when transfigured by his love for the wife of a rich banker. He later embarked on an extraordinarily ambitious sequence of hymns exploring cosmology and history, from mythological times to the discovery of America and his own era. The &#x2019;Canticles of Night&#x2019;, by contrast, include enigmatic fragments in an unprecedented style, which anticipates the Symbolists and Surrealists. Together the works collected here show H�lderlin&#x2019;s use of Classical and Christian imagery and his exploration of cosmology and history in an attempt to find meaning in an uncertain world.</p><p>As well as his poems on classical themes, the German poet Friedrich Holderlin (1770-1843) is author of the novel HYPERION. Michael Hamburger was born in Berlin in 1924. His family emigrated to England in 1933. His own collections of poetry include FLOWERING CACTUS, WEATHER AND SEASON and OWNERLESS EARTH: NEW AND SELECTED POEMS, and his many distinguished translations include versions of Hofmannsthal and Grass, as well as the POEMS AND FRAGMENTS, on which he worked for many years.Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Learning True Love: Practicing Buddhism in a Time of War</h2><p><i>Learning True Love</i>, the autobiography of Sister Ch�n Kh�ng, stands alongside the great spiritual autobiographies of our century. It tells the story of her spiritual and personal odyssey, both in her homeland and in exile. Its anecdotal style presents an intensely personal portrait of a woman with astonishing courage, offering us a perspective on the suffering of the Vietnamese people. This unique autobiography tells the gripping story of a woman who not only lived but made history, and whose life of single-minded dedication to humanity can serve as an inspiration for us all.<br><br>Sister Ch�n Kh�ng was born in a village on the Mekong River Delta in 1938. In her teens she devoted her life to the development and practice of nonviolence grounded in the Buddhist precepts of non-killing and compassionate action. Propelled by her passionate dedication to social change, she began working in the slums of Saigon, distributing food, working with the sick, and teaching children. When she was 21 years old she met the man who until to this day remains her teacher and spiritual companion: Thich Nhat Hanh. With him she co-founded the School of Youth for Social Service in 1964, which grew to an organization of over 10,000 young people organizing medical, educational, and agricultural facilities in rural Vietnam, and rebuilding villages destroyed in the fighting. Sister Ch�n Kh�ng became well known in the anti-war and peace community for her work promoting human rights and protesting repression and violence, often at risk of her own life. She continues to do this work today.&nbsp;<br><br>After the war she became one of the co-founders of Plum Village, the spiritual center, that is home to Thich Nhat Hanh's community in France, where she continues to be deeply involved in the development and vision for this unique community.<br><br>In January of 2005, after nearly 40 years in exile, Sister Ch�n Kh�ng was able to return on a 3-month visit to Vietnam. In this fully revised edition of <i>Learning True Love</i> she movingly describes the return to her homeland, the reunions with many old friends and fellow activists, and shares her impression of the "new Vietnam," where Buddhists still struggle for religious freedom and the re-establishment of their own organizations.&nbsp;<br><br><i>Learning True Love</i> is a moving personal memoir, an introduction to the mindfulness teachings and life of Thich Nhat Hanh and his community in exile, an overview to the development of the European and American peace and human rights movement, and an introduction to the engaged and practical style of Vietnamese Buddhism. It documents the process that brought an end to the US Vietnam war, and gives a lively summary of Vietnamese history from 1945 to the current political, social and spiritual climate in Vietnam. <i>Learning True Love</i> also portraits some of the many remarkable people that shared Sister Ch�n Kh�ng 's path.<br><br>Foremost however it is the remarkable and impressive story of a very courageous woman, whose journey from an accredited biologist at the University of Paris to a Buddhist nun, gives her unique insight into life's central questions and the ability to address them in an unflinching and straightforward manner.&nbsp;<br><br>Forewords by Thich Nhat Hanh and Maxine Hong-Kingston</p><p>Sister Ch�n Kh�ng (birth name Cao Ngoc Phuong) was born in a village on the Mekong River Delta in 1938. She has devoted her life to the development and practice of nonviolence grounded in the Buddhist precepts of non-killing and compassionate action. She is part of the community of Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh and lives in Plum Village, France.This work is a transcript of taped "Dharma talks" given by a Vietnamese Buddhist nun who has dedicated her life to the poor and destitute of her homeland, both inside Vietnam and in exile from abroad. Alas, the English is often poor, and the strings of reminiscences are recorded in a chaotic style. In addition, very few details specific to Chan's Buddhist worldview are explained adequately, if at all. These shortcomings hurt the effectiveness of a fascinating story. This is a rare example of a social, rather than a political or historical, perspective on Vietnam that could potentially be of interest to the general public. However, in its current form, it cannot be recommended.<br><i>- Ria Koopmans de Bruijn, C.V.

Based on the abstract, general style of mathematical exposition favored by research mathematicians, its goal was to teach students not just to manipulate numbers and formulas, but to grasp the underlying mathematical concepts. The result, at least at first, was a great deal of confusion among teachers, students, and parents. Since then, the negative aspects of "new math" have been eliminated and its positive elements assimilated into classroom instruction.<br>In this charming volume, a noted English mathematician uses humor and anecdote to illuminate the concepts underlying "new math": groups, sets, subsets, topology, Boolean algebra, and more. According to Professor Stewart, an understanding of these concepts offers the best route to grasping the true nature of mathematics, in particular the power, beauty, and utility of <i>pure </i>mathematics. No advanced mathematical background is needed (a smattering of algebra, geometry, and trigonometry is helpful) to follow the author's lucid and thought-provoking discussions of such topics as functions, symmetry, axiomatics, counting, topology, hyperspace, linear algebra, real analysis, probability, computers, applications of modern mathematics, and much more.<br>By the time readers have finished this book, they'll have a much clearer grasp of how modern mathematicians look at figures, functions, and formulas and how a firm grasp of the ideas underlying "new math" leads toward a genuine comprehension of the nature of mathematics itself.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Dogmatic Constitution on the Church: Lumen Gentium</h2><p>This document focuses on the whole Church as a communion of charity, shedding light on the Church&#39;s reality--a wonderful but complex reality consisting of human and divine elements, visible and invisible. The described Church is rich in life and is opening up with greater energy to the world in a community of faith, hope, and love. The document also addresses the collegial and cooperative relationships of the bishops of the world among themselves and with the pope, and their status together as the supreme authority in the Church.</p><p></p><h2>Babar and His Children</h2><p>Such joy in Celesteville! Babar and Celeste have had triplets. The smallest, Alexander, has a knack for getting into predicaments. Between getting stuck in the treetops and being chased by a crocodile, he certainly keeps Babar on his toes, but the king readily admits, &#x201c;Truly it is not easy to bring up a family, but how nice the babies are!&#x201d; The fifth Babar story is a wonderful and heartwarming salute to parenthood which every Mom and Dad will appreciate.</p><p>One of Jean de Brunhoff's five original Babar stories, <i>Babar and His Children</i> tells how the royal elephant and Queen Celeste await the birth of their first child... and discover to their surprise that they have three! The loyal townsfolk bring gifts, and the babies are named before being weighed by wise Dr. Capoulosse (he of the stern expression and pince-nez). Then it's time for young Flora, Pom, and Alexander to get into a series of scrapes and be saved by the bravery and good sense of either their parents or other animals. Brunhoff's charming, faintly Edwardian illustrations never cease to capture the imagination, and this particular story has something in it for every member of a young family--even if some members of your family are merely human. (Ages 2 to 6) <i>--Richard Farr</i>One morning Babar said to Cornelius: &#39;Old Friend, you who have been my constant companion through good times and bad, listen now to my wonderful news. Celeste, My wife, has just told me that she is expecting a baby.&#39;After having congratulated and thanked Babar, Cornelius puts on his full-dress uniform. Standing before the gateway if the Royal Palace, he tells his drummer to assemble the townspeople.</p><h2>The Sustainable Vegetable Garden: A Backyard Guide to Healthy Soil and Higher Yields</h2><p>From the author of our best-selling and widely beloved HOW TO GROW MORE VEGETABLES comes this "quick and dirty" introduction to biointensive gardening that shows it is not only possible but easy to grow astonishing crops of healthful organic vegetables and fruits, while conserving resources and actually helping the soil. A revolutionary approach to feeding ourselves and nurturing the land, this book includes:<br>- Step-by-step illustrations and instructions that make these techniques simple for even the novice gardener.<br>- Everything you need to know about planning crops, composting, harvesting, and more.<br>- Complete resources for seeds, tools, and other garden supplies.Feed a family of four on the bounty of your backyard, or just get more out of your garden with less effort with this wonderful resource.</p><p>JOHN JEAVONS is a cofounder of the group Ecology Action and the father of the modern biointensive gardening movement. He lives in Willits, California, where he has been growing more vegetables for decades.Jeavons and Cox offer a less technical version of Jeavons's best-selling book on biointensive gardening, How To Grow More Vegetables Than You Ever Thought Possible on Less Land Than You Can Imagine, published over 25 years ago. Written for both the beginner and the experienced gardener, this new book shows how to cultivate 11 commonly grown vegetables, calorie crops (beans), or compost crops in 100-square-foot plots using organic, soil-enriching methods. The authors discuss biointensive gardening theory, preparing garden beds, composting, starting seeds, growing crops, and collecting seeds. They offer detailed instructions and equations showing how to calculate how many seeds to plant to get the necessary seedlings to fill the suggested garden plans and suggest ways to customize garden plots. While the equations are easy to follow, the calculations and numerous charts may intimidate the beginner, who may also need more information on gardening techniques.

They were working pastors, involved in the daily life and leadership of their congregations. Yet they were wrestling with many of the great and formative questions of the Christian faith, such as the Trinity, the incarnation, the providence of God and the nature of the church. These beliefs were defined in the crucible of spiritual leadership, pastoral care and theological conflict, all set against the background of the great cultural movements and events of their day. For the church fathers, theology was a spiritual exercise woven into the texture of life. What would it be like to sit under the preaching and instruction of these great men, to look over their shoulders as they thought and wrote, or to hear them debate theological issues? <em>Learning Theology with the Church Fathers</em> offers us that experience. With the same insight and love of his subject that he brought to <em>Reading Scripture with the Church Fathers,</em> Christopher A. Hall opens the door on patristic theology. Focusing on the great questions, we view these issues in their settings and find greater appreciation for the foundations and architecture of our Christian faith.</p><p>Christopher A. Hall (PhD, Drew University) is the president of Renovar�. He is associate editor of the Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture, and his books include <em>Reading Scripture with the Church Fathers</em>, <em>Learning Theology with the Church Fathers</em>, and <em>Worshiping with the Church Fathers</em>. Hall previously served at Eastern University for over twenty years in several roles, including chancellor, provost, dean of Palmer Seminary, dean of the Templeton Honors College, distinguished professor of theology, and director of academic spiritual formation. He and his wife, Debbie, live in Pennsylvania and have three grown children.</p><h2>Jazzology: The Encyclopedia of Jazz Theory for All Musicians</h2><p>(Jazz Instruction). A one-of-a-kind book encompassing a wide scope of jazz topics, for beginners and pros of any instrument.

Certainly jazz is freedom of expression, but you have to know what you&#39;re doing and this book is the tool for that ...

As founding Director of the Conflict Transformation Program and Institute of Peacebuilding at Eastern Mennonite University, he has provided consultation and direct mediation in a range of situations from the Miskito/Sandinista conflict in Nicaragua to Somalia, Northern Ireland, the Basque Country, and the Philippines. His influential 1997 book <em>Building Peace</em> has become a classic in the discipline. This new book represents his thinking and learning over the past several years. He explores the evolution of his understanding of peacebuilding by reflecting on his own experiences in the field. Peacebuilding, in his view, is both a learned skill and an art. Finding this art, he says, requires a worldview shift. Conflict professionals must envision their work as a creative act - an exercise of what Lederach terms the "moral imagination."<br></p><p><br><strong>John Paul Lederach</strong> is one of the world's foremost experts on peacebuilding and reconciliation. He is Professor of International Peacebuilding at the Joan B. Kroc Institute of International Peace Studies at the University of Notre Dame and Distinguished Scholar at Eastern Mennonite University's Conflict Transformation Program. Among his many books are <em>The Journey Toward Reconciliation</em> (1999) and <em>Building Peace: Sustainable Reconciliation in Divided Societies</em> (1997).<br><br>"Today the telecommunications and transport revolution has made the world a smaller place offering both an opportunity and challenge to the major leading countries to come together to shape the world, overcome violence and create a peaceful global community. John Paul Lederach presents a powerful case for the use of the moral imagination in rising to this challenge, thus creating authentic new possibilities. This book provides a valuable contribution to peacebuilding literature and I welcome it wholeheartedly." --John Hume, Winner of the Nobel Prize for Peace<p></p><br>"This is a wonderful book it resonated, provoked and exhilarated me, challenging me to think very carefully and deeply about why peace builders do what they do. It also offers some profound compass points for direction which may help to keep many of us sane and focused in the midst of the chaos and violence that so often makes up our world." --Mari Fitzduff, Brandeis University<p></p><br>"<em>The Moral Imagination</em> is an eloquent and personal meditation on the challenge of peacebuilding by one of the fields most insightful theorists and practitioners. Professor Lederach correctly observes that the years following the tragedy of September 11, 2001, represent a precious opportunity to address underlying cycles of violence and insecurity, locally and globally. It will take courage and creativity, but it is an opportunity we must not let pass us by."--Jimmy Carter, Chairman, The Carter Center<p></p><br>"Much exists in the conflict resolution literature about method and technique, little about art and soul. John Paul Lederach, a theorist of great insight who also happens to be a practitioner of high skill, brings us deep into his own process of learning--and the results are marvelous. He offers us a rich fare of insights, stories and metaphors that captivate the moral imagination this world so badly needs. Consider this book a precious treat!" --William Ury, co-author of <em>Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement without Giving In</em> and author of <em>The Third Side: Why We Fight and How We Can</em> <em>Stop</em><p></p><br>"In its depth of wisdom regarding the dynamics of soul, spirit and society that lead good people to become effective practitioners of conflict transformation in war zones, <em>The Moral Imagination</em> could serve as the magnificent capstone to a life's work. The thrilling fact, however, is that Lederach stands not at the end but at the midpoint of a remarkable journey of conciliation, peacebuilding and ethical reflection. This book is a milestone in that journey; there is nothing quite like it in the literature of social change, peace and conflict studies, theology, ethics, and spirituality--for it weaves those disciplines together into a seamless, riveting whole."--R. Scott Appleby, Professor of History and John M. Regan, Jr. Director of the Joan B. Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies, University of Notre Dame<p></p><br>"In <em>The Moral Imagination</em>, John Paul Lederach has written an inspiring and uplifting book that goes straight to the heart of what is required to bring a change in a destructive cycle of violence, to alter an oppressive social relationship, or to understand the foundation of an intractable conflict. Lederach uses the tools of natural science, poetry, folk lore, and physics, as well the wisdom of people who have exhibited courage in the face of violence, to consider the essence of effective peacemaking. This is a book that will help deepen the thinking and the peacemaking practice of all who read it."--Bernard Mayer, author of <em>Beyond Neutrality: Confronting the Crisis in Conflict Resolution</em><p></p><br>"Peacemaking is about imagining what seems impossible in the midst of conflict. It is about discerning and stretching the moment of opportunity. This is a superb book, offering theory born in practice and best practices grounded in critical theory. It raises problems and suggests solutions. The work of activists, scholars and practitioners in conflict transformation and peacemaking who read this book will be profoundly influenced by it."--Charles Villa-Vicencio, Executive Director, Institute for Justice and Reconciliation, Cape Town, South Africa<p></p><br>"Anyone who feels the call of peacemaking should read this book and reflect deeply." --<em>The Mennonite Quarterly Review</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Dari-English/English-Dari Dictionary &amp; Phrasebook (Hippocrene Dictionary &amp; Phrasebooks)</h2><p>Compiled by a linguist specializing in the region, this two-way pocket dictionary and phrasebook offers a map of Afghanistan; information useful for relief workers, business people, and travelers; and a concise grammar, pronunciation guide, and alphabet for one of the country&#39;s official languages.</p><p>Nicholas Awde is an author and linguist specializing in the Caucasus, the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa.

Griffin</b>&nbsp;is the author of seven bestselling series: The Corps, Brotherhood of War, Badge of Honor, Men at War, Honor Bound, Presidential Agent, and now Clandestine Operations. He lives in Fairhope, Alabama, and Buenos Aires, Argentina.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;Griffin already has a high profile in Berkley paperback; his six-volume Brotherhood of War saga, a Green Beret epic spanning WW II to Richard Nixon's presidency, has more than three million copies in print. With The New Breed, the series segues into hardcover, but this is not so much a sequel as a lengthy missing chapter from volume six. In late 1963, Col. Sandy Felter, formerly JFK's private Ollie North, returns from secret missions to Vietnam and the Congo and persuades new president LBJ that the Congo is as volatile as Southeast Asia. Felter's longtime friend, Manhattan banking scion Lt. Col. Craig Lowell, helps secure a crew that can combat any rebellion. Among the cast of characters: Jack Portet, an Army private who grew up flying planes in the Congo; Marjorie Bellmon, an officer's daughter for whom Jack goes "Top Gun"; Karl-Heinz Wagner, an East German who escaped through the Berlin Wall with his sister, Ursula; and Geoff Craig, Lowell's young Army cousin and Ursula's husband. The novel moves quickly, if somewhat disjointedly; Griffin's short-chapter, staccato style hampers continuity. He is also so entrenched in military jargon and lifestyle that the civilian reader may sometimes be confused. Those who have had some exposure to the service, however, will experience jolts of recognition in the hard-hitting narrative.

Abuse too painful to put into words does have a language, though, a language of coded signs and symptoms that conventional therapy fails to understand. In this luminous, deeply moving book, Rogers reveals how she has helped many girls find expression and healing for the sexual trauma that has shattered their childhoods. <br><br>Rogers opens with a harrowing account of her own emotional collapse in childhood and goes on to illustrate its significance to how she hears and understands trauma in her clinical work. Years after her breakdown, when she discovered the brilliant work of French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, Rogers at last had the key she needed to unlock the secrets of the unsayable. With Lacan&#x2019;s theory of language and its layered associations as her guide, Rogers was able to make startling connections with seemingly unreachable girls who had lost years of childhood, who had endured the unspeakable in silence.<br><br>At the heart of the book is the searing portrait of the girl Rogers calls Ellen, brutally abused for three years by her teenage male babysitter. Over the course of seven years of therapy, Rogers helped Ellen find words for the terrible things that had happened to her, face up to the unconscious patterns through which she replayed the trauma, and learn to live beyond the shadows of the past. Through Ellen&#x2019;s story, Rogers illuminates the complex, intimate unraveling of trauma between therapist and child, as painful truths and their consequences come to light in unexpected ways.<br><br>Like Judith Herman&#x2019;s Trauma and Recovery and Kay Redfield Jamison&#x2019;s An Unquiet Mind, <i>The Unsayable</i> is a book with the power to change the way we think about suffering and self-expression. For those who have experienced psychological trauma, and for those who yearn to help, this brave, compelling book will be a touchstone of lucid understanding and true healing.</p><p>Annie G. Rogers, Ph.D., is associate professor of clinical psychology at Hampshire College.

Dark mesh screens rose fifteen feet high, divided by thin black iron poles that parceled the sky into parallelograms. Above me a ledge stuck out its tongue, dark and square, and made a long shadow all along one side of the porch. I had not spoken for over a month. I stood on the porch and saw everything in sharp relief. The silence pressed in on me and opened up with sound: keys in a remote hallway, feet shuffling on linoleum, a squirrel&#x2019;s scuffle across the bare ground into leaves three stories below. Nothing was expected of me. I lay down on a battered couch and studied the sky.<br><br> Going into St. Vincent&#x2019;s Hospital was like walking into a dream&#x2014;first you notice something you assume is only an inconsequential detail, but it turns out to be what is most important. The hospital&#x2019;s entrance was a stone arch. Inside, a fountain in the center of the foyer rose and fell. I heard angels singing in that fountain and was cheered. I called myself Joan (but answered to others calling me Annie) and knew myself to be Joan of Arc. I was glad that my messengers were here with me. In that moment my name faded out and hers remained on the screen, like a film credit.<br><br> I did not expect locked doors. I stayed on the adolescent ward for a couple of weeks before being transferred to 2 North, the ward for the &#x201c;crazies,&#x201d; &#x201c;chronics,&#x201d; and &#x201c;psychotics&#x201d; in the hospital. I didn&#x2019;t have the slightest idea why, and I noticed I was the only young person there. I was a patient in a private psychiatric hospital now, the kind of place you only have nightmares about&#x2014;red brick, far from the road, bars on tall windows. It even had high turrets. It was there, as a sixteen-year-old girl, that I stopped speaking for five months, from October to February. I realized that whatever I might say could be misconstrued and used to create a version of &#x201c;reality&#x201d; that would be unrecognizable, a kind of voice-over of my truths I could not bear. I embraced silence as though it were both protest and protection. As though, because in the end it was neither.<br><br> It was early and still dark when the nurse entered my room and injected a burning stream into my thin upper arm. The routine was familiar. Within ten minutes my mouth was dry, my tongue enormous and clumsy. Then there was the long walk in my blue robe (a present from my mother) through the hospital tunnels with another nurse, who crooked her arm in mine as though I were her guide. And then we were there. The tunnel opened into an underground waiting room, lit with lamps, a relief from the fluorescence of the tunnel. At first I thought, &#x201c;Here are the grandparents,&#x201d; because everyone there seemed unspeakably old. Then I saw that it was because they were all folded in on themselves, heads bent, chests concave, and breathing shallow. It was a waiting room, with magazines stacked neatly on a coffee table, but no one, no, not one person, was reading. To read is to be drawn away from the confines of the body and the present moment into another time and place. But everyone here was imprisoned in the immediate anguish that superseded the tedium of waiting, which might have, at another time, been relieved by reading.<br><br> Minutes later I lay down on a gurney in a small room and surrendered my St. Christopher&#x2019;s medal from around my neck, assured that it would be returned later. Then came the tourniquet&#x2019;s pinch, my hand going numb even as I was told to &#x201c;make a fist.&#x201d; A prick into vein, and then the tease, &#x201c;Count backwards from ten.&#x201d; But the dizziness at seven and the solid blackness at five or four made it impossible. The first time I went for ECT, they strapped me down with surprising gentleness, attaching the electrodes to my scalp. I was ready to be a martyr but at the last moment struggled with such ferocity that the procedure was abandoned.<br><br> I didn&#x2019;t have a word for my anguish, not even a signal, unless it was this unexpected struggle. If this was my cry, it was so mute that no one could hear it.<br><br> I wakened with my mouth drier than before, if that was possible. Someone led me to a table where there was butter-soaked toast and a cup of orange juice. I didn&#x2019;t know it then, wouldn&#x2019;t know it until I returned to the world, to music classes and to school. I didn&#x2019;t know that a little electricity to the brain in weekly doses adds up to oblivion. It adds up by subtracting all recently learned systems of notation and language. Gone, the capacity to read music (to play classical guitar and sing), along with algebra, geometry, and drawing in perspective. I could no longer read Virgil or even decipher my own coded alphabet. I couldn&#x2019;t remember any French, and Latin, too, was gone. These things had fled, all to the same place&#x2014;words for a lost city, street names, music, lines of poetry.<br><br> Joan drank the orange juice with relish. She savored the toast.<br><br> 2<br><br> Once, in Latin class, my messengers spoke to me from the inside of a book cabinet. I threw my books off my desk, shouting, &#x201c;Stop!&#x201d; I&#x2019;d meant to stop the girls&#x2019; voices around me so I could hear my voices more clearly, but class ended abruptly and everyone filed out. Sister Stanislaus brought me to the health room (an empty room with a cot and a crucifix) and locked me inside until my mother came to get me. Everyone, my family included, assumed I was on drugs. Only I knew that Michael the Archangel had assigned me a task: I was to find a way to translate the voices of angels for the world, to find words and an alphabet that would put an end to human suffering.<br><br> By swallowing every pill, tablet, and caplet I could lay my hands on I thought I&#x2019;d make a start at dying without being burned at the stake. Then, just in case this was a laughable beginning, I opened up my wrists with a blade, as if I could open time itself. I didn&#x2019;t expect so much blood. Under the skin, within the geography of my own body, I wanted to find the IGA at the corner of Tamm Avenue and Berthold, taste Wonder bread butter-and-sugar sandwiches, hear the chanted counting as everyone took off running in a game of hide-and-seek. I wanted to run in a pack of bare-armed children, run with endless energy, stung by mosquitoes as fireflies increased in glass jars. The sink filled with blood as I watched with disbelief.<br><br> I felt quite dizzy. I called the convent and spoke to my English teacher, Sister Bianca. I could not keep track of what was happening in this conversation. Sister Bianca brought my biology teacher along with her to the apartment. It was Sister Peter who tore up the pillowcases to staunch the bleeding (what would my mother say, I wondered). The arrival of an ambulance seemed overly dramatic. Just before the doors closed Sister Bianca leaned in and addressed me. &#x201c;I think you did this because you wanted to live.&#x201d; I did not respond. I sped into silence in an ambulance screaming through the night.<br><br> In the emergency room, the burning of a nose tube in the back of my throat triggered the thought that I was already on fire. I fought to get up, but the doctors prevailed and pumped the pills from my stomach with alarming indifference. Then there was the strange tug of needle and thread while being sewn up (as I&#x2019;d sewn my own stuffed animals).<br><br> I was sent to a ward for public patients, my bed in a large room, on the fourth floor of the St. Louis City Hospital, an old building with clanging radiators. I thought that the effort to die would change me in some fundamental way, or change the world. But nothing had changed. I lay in bed with an IV drip, wanting to pee almost constantly. The green walls whispered, hummed, and spoke strange syllables. Angles tilted and tables became flat, yet things didn&#x2019;t drop off as they should have. In an open ward with rows of beds, in that public and very large space, the walls crept closer to my bed and enclosed me.<br><br> Hours later two psychiatrists came to see me. They asked me why I&#x2019;d tried to kill myself, and then they guessed. &#x201c;Is it that your boyfriend left you?&#x201d; &#x201c;Were you doing drugs? Flunking out of school?&#x201d; &#x201c;Maybe you wanted someone to notice you.&#x201d; I decided I would not speak again until someone said something at least intelligent enough for me to try to answer. And so I entered silence with an attitude of insouciant power that belied a terrible vulnerability&#x2014;it was the exaggeration of the teenager&#x2019;s shrug, the ubiquitous gesture when speech fails.<br><br> Crossing over into silence, I was La Pucelle, the virgin girl guided by voices, the girl who would fight and win, and this time would not be killed.<br><br> 3<br><br> Released finally from the constant companionship of my IV, I lay in bed and punched out a visual hole just above the light switch at the far end of the ward&#x2014;and lined up the ends of iron bedsteads all down the row in one-point perspective. I turned to the other side of the room and shot a bullet hole through the window on the same horizon and had two points. To line up the beds in two-point perspective, however, I had to imagine being in a third space in the room where I could see both points at once. Try as I might, I couldn&#x2019;t quite imagine this view, so I got up out of bed to see. When I did, I noticed the wheelchair down by the windows. It was an old one, high-backed with wooden platforms for the feet. The seat and back were an intricacy of cane work gone nearly white with age.<br><br> I spent hours and days looking at that wheelchair from my bed. Depending on the time, it was all honeycomb and lace, little hexagons of light against dark and light against brighter light. The verticals and horizontals switched places in a moment. It was a repetition of moving hexagons, a metric, all rhythm and syncopation. At night it was dark against darker dark. Its shapes stood out and it became all plane, arc, and infinity. One night I moved out of my bed and walked up to it. I sat in it. The seat edge hit my legs just below the knee and my legs dangled out like a child&#x2019;s&#x2014;it was that big. It was a home with an open roof and open walls. It was time itself and it was beyond all time.<br><br> I grew bored with the hospital routines. I took the wheelchair out for a little spin, as other kids might borrow the family car. At first I stayed on the ward. The old people smiled a little as I traveled up and down between the rows. I didn&#x2019;t dare smile back, in case any of them wanted to make it an obligation to speak to them. Then, when everyone became used to seeing me in it and none of the nurses were around, I took it out into the hospital. In the corridor I found a group of men in white coats, all foreign doctors, waiting by the elevator. They smiled, as if charmed by the sight of a girl in a wheelchair, and the elevator opened and let them, and me, in, and leapt up for a moment and swept down, signaling each floor with a little &#x201c;ching.&#x201d; I got out in front of the gift shop, on the ground floor. I could have walked out the front door, but this did not interest me. I was content to roll around in the lobby, as if out on a ride, and look at the people, almost all black and visibly poor, chatting with one another, calling out to children who laughed and skipped over the tiles. With my bandaged wrists and wheelchair and dressed as I was in the costume of a hospital gown and robe, I imagined that I looked like someone who had a physical illness. I took refuge in this idea, turning the chair this way and that, smiling with a private pleasure. I was happy enough to be in a world in which I played no real part, knowing I had a part in another world that no one knew about.<br><br> This is my last memory before going into St. Vincent&#x2019;s, waiting for signs from another world in which I had a part to play. My messengers had temporarily forsaken me, but I knew it was only a matter of time before the roaring became whispering and the whispering shifted to clear voices. The old, familiar sense of vastness and infinity was all around me, in ordinary things, most memorably in the wheelchair. I felt near to my own death, too, not because I&#x2019;d tried to kill myself, but because I sensed that unseen others wanted me dead. The nearness of death made it imperative that I live in a world that did not follow the logic of linear time&#x2014;so time skipped and jumped and ran backward into infinity.<br><br> 4<br><br> What can I say about being in the hospital? Almost nothing. No more than I have said already.<br><br> It was May, in what would have been my junior year in high school, and my psychiatrist, after nine months of treating me, had finally arrived at a diagnosis: schizophrenia. When he told my mother that he was planning to transfer me from St. Vincent&#x2019;s to Malcolm Bliss State Hospital for an indeterminable period, she put her foot down, saying, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing so wrong with her that can&#x2019;t be righted by coming home.&#x201d;<br><br> Nothing had changed, yet everything had changed. I could see, as I climbed out of the art-room window onto the roof of Rosati-Kain High School, that I would have to jump or swing out to the nearest branch to get down. If caught, I could be suspended. Since I had just returned from the loony bin, maybe this sojourn on the roof would be forgiven. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to be here,&#x201d; I thought. &#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t want to go back to the hospital either.&#x201d; I climbed back in through the window, took up my notebook, and tore out a page and began a letter. I wrote it to my father, dead since I was five, and addressed it to The Dead Letter Room, St. Louis, Missouri.<br><br> I don&#x2019;t remember the letter. As an adolescent I barely remembered my father. His facial features and the sound of his voice had faded over the years. He was a familiar ghost, a present absence. I imagined him and my response to his death because I couldn&#x2019;t actually remember him.</p><h2>A Clinical Introduction to Lacanian Psychoanalysis: Theory and Technique</h2><p><p>"The goal of my teaching has always been, and remains, to train analysts."<br>--Jacques Lacan, Seminar XI, 209</p><p>Arguably the most profound psychoanalytic thinker since Freud, and deeply influential in many fields, Jacques Lacan often seems opaque to those he most wanted to reach.

In addition to his novels he also wrote numerous screenplays, most notably The Three Musketeers and the James Bond film Octopussy. George MacDonald Fraser died in January 2008 at the age of 82.<i>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t wait to die on the field of honour. Heroes draw no higher wages than the others.&#x2019;</i> &#x2013; soldier of fortune Paolo di Avitabile in <i>Flashman</i><br><br>Just before World War I, Mark Franklin, the hero of George MacDonald Fraser&#x2019;s Mr American, travels to London, where he spends a bibulous evening with an elderly military man by the name of Sir Harry Paget Flashman. &#x2018;He had looked Sir Harry up in Who&#x2019;s Who and read incredulously through the succinct list of campaigns and decorations &#x2013; that gnarled old man sleeping there had seen Custer ride into the broken bluffs above the Little Big Horn, and fought hand to hand with Afghan tribesmen more than seventy years ago; he had ridden into the guns at Balaclava and seen the ranks form for Pickett&#x2019;s charge at Gettysburg; he had known Wellington and Lincoln . . .&#x2019;<br><br>Who wouldn&#x2019;t be incredulous? Sir Harry&#x2019;s numerous honors include not only England&#x2019;s Victoria Cross, but also the French Legion of Honour and the American Congressional Medal of Honor. His Who&#x2019;s Who entry &#x2013; should you ever happen upon it &#x2013; requires four inches of small type just to list some of his nearly unbelievable exploits. During the course of a long life, Sir Harry Paget Flashman (1822&#x2013;1915) served as a political adviser to Chancellor Bismarck on the Schleswig-Holstein question, briefly functioned as chief of staff to the Rajah of Sarawak, rode with both John Brown and Jeb Stuart, and even assisted the Emperor Maximilian of Mexico as an aide-decamp. Over the years this far-ranging traveler also spent some time as a buffalo hunter, western scout, Australian prospector, &#x2018;reluctant deputy marshal to J. B. Hickok, Esq.,&#x2019; and native interpreter &#x2013; Sir Harry spoke nine languages fluently and could &#x2018;rub along&#x2019; in another dozen or so.<br><br>Naturally, Who&#x2019;s Who &#x2013; with British discretion &#x2013; barely hints that Harry Flashman frequently spied for Her Majesty&#x2019;s government and that he was mixed up in both the African slave trade and the Underground Railroad. Moreover, through a run of astonishing bad luck, the man seems to have landed smack in the middle of virtually every major battle or civil insurrection of the nineteenth century &#x2013; the Siege of Gandamack in Afghanistan, the Zulu attack at Rorke&#x2019;s Drift, the rising of the Mahdi at Khartoum, the Charge of the Light Brigade, the Battle of Chancellorsville, the Peking Rebellion of 1900. During the American Civil War he even inexplicably managed to serve as a major in the Union forces and a colonel in the army of the Confederacy.<br><br>As it happens, when Mr Franklin met Sir Harry the then 92- year-old general had recently completed his personal memoirs, memoirs so disturbing that after his death they were quickly sealed and, it would appear, instantly forgotten. Indeed, the memory of Sir Harry himself gradually faded away, so that otherwise reliable histories of the Victorian era failed to assign him even a footnote. But, then, in 1965 during a sale of household furniture at Ashby in Leicestershire, the manuscript miraculously resurfaced. Ably edited by George MacDonald Fraser, the so-called Flashman Papers were eventually published in twelve volumes, each &#x2018;packet&#x2019; focusing on one or more episodes from their author&#x2019;s martial career. They begin with the teenaged Flashman&#x2019;s expulsion from Rugby School for drunkenness &#x2013; an incident mentioned in Thomas Hughes&#x2019;s almost libelous Tom Brown&#x2019;s School Days &#x2013; and follow him up to the unpleasantness, very late in his life, with Colonel Sebastian &#x2018;Tiger Jack&#x2019; Moran. That last name may be familiar, as Moran was once described by the consulting detective Sherlock Holmes as &#x2018;the second most dangerous man in London&#x2019; and &#x2018;the best heavy-game shot that our Eastern Empire has ever produced&#x2019;.<br><br>But, really, what impropriety in these reminiscences could have offended the sensibilities of the Flashman family? The author was the most upright of eminent Victorians, the recipient of the San Serafino Order of Purity and Truth, the honorary president of the Mission for the Reclamation of Reduced Females, and the former governor of his alma mater, that bastion of muscular Christianity, Rugby School. Perhaps Sir Harry&#x2019;s family, in particular his clerical son, the Reverend<br>Bishop Harry Albert Victor Flashman, simply felt it wiser for posterity to honor a public career already well documented in Dawns and Departures of a Soldier&#x2019;s Life and &#x2019;Twixt Cossack and Cannon. Yet time has not been kind to these stiffly official memoirs. They are as forgotten now as if they had never existed, while great scholars and common readers alike return regularly to the Flashman Papers for instruction and delight. And, it goes without saying, for the irresistible brazen effrontery of the man himself. For in these memoirs, Sir Harry Flashman, the supposed Victorian equivalent of a &#x2018;parfit gentil knyght,&#x2019; reveals himself to be &#x2013; in his own words &#x2013; &#x2018;a scoundrel, a liar, a cheat, a thief, a coward &#x2013; and, oh yes, a toady.&#x2019;<br><br>In fact, Flashman is one of the world&#x2019;s most entertaining and beguiling rogues. He pursues life&#x2019;s pleasures with Casanovian gusto, regularly employs the colorful language of the barracks, and knows that &#x2018;there isn&#x2019;t any folly a man won&#x2019;t contemplate if there&#x2019;s money or a woman at stake.&#x2019; With his gallant sidewhiskers, bold dark eyes with hooded lids, and strong, aquiline nose, this charming dastard &#x2013; fourteen stone of sheer manliness &#x2013; regularly seduces schoolgirls and queens, hides or runs away when fights break out, and manages, through deception and utter poltroonery, to survive when better men die. As he says (in Royal Flash): &#x2018;The ideal time to be a hero is when the battle is over and the other fellows are dead, God rest &#x2019;em, and you take the credit.&#x2019;<br><br>The three startling, even shocking adventures reprinted in this Everyman omnibus provide the ideal introduction to Sir Harry&#x2019;s rumbustious life. In Flashman the youthful anti-hero spends his last day at Rugby, enlists in the army, captures the heart (and body) of the fair-haired Elspeth, and reluctantly embarks on a mission to mountainous, war-torn Afghanistan. In Flash for Freedom! the luckless Flashy joins the crew of an African slave ship, unwillingly assists the Underground Railroad, and fortuitously meets a rising young American politician named Abraham Lincoln. (In later years, Lincoln was known to say: &#x2018;When all other trusts fail, turn to Flashman.&#x2019; I believe that the word &#x2018;all&#x2019; should be emphasized.) Finally, Flashman in the Great Game takes our man into the world of Kim, as he spies for the British, dallies with a luscious maharani, and desperately struggles to survive the blood-baths of the Sepoy Mutiny.<br><br>That he does so will hardly come as a surprise, nor that he emerges from his Indian nightmare not only alive but also elevated to a knighthood. Nevertheless, a few crudely unimaginative critics have suggested that nobody could actually have escaped from so many deadly ambushes and battles. Two or three have even gone so far as to speculate that George Mac-DonaldFraser is&nbsp; the&nbsp; author, not the editor, of the Flashman Papers, with the deeply cynical implication that Flashman himself is merely a character in a series of clever novels. Sigh. What can you expect these days from cloistered academics, none of whom is even half as alive as Flashman? Flashy may not be as admirable as, say, Don Quixote, Lord Greystoke or Sherlock Holmes, but he&#x2019;s certainly just as real.</p><h2>The Black Dagger Brotherhood: An Insider&#39;s Guide</h2><p><b><i>New York Times</i> bestselling author J.R.

Hell, he owed her. But he had to remind himself of his manners: It would be damn tacky to bite the head off a female who was not only your brother&#x2019;s <i>shellan</i>, but who had saved the love of your life from bleeding out on the birth table.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s recovered beautifully in the last two months.&#x201d; Doc Jane watched him from the table across the way, her <i>Marcus Welby, M.D.</i>, bag beside her ghostly hand. &#x201c;And Nalla&#x2019;s thriving. Man, vampire young progress so much faster than human babies. Cognitively, it&#x2019;s like she&#x2019;s nine months old.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re doing great.&#x201d; He kept slicing, moving his hand down and through, down and through. On the far side of the blade, the leaves sprang free in curly green ribbons like they were clapping at having been liberated.</p><p>&#x201c;And how are you doing with the whole dad thing&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fuck!&#x201d;</p><p>Dropping the knife, he cursed and brought up the hand that had been on the lettuce. The cut was deep, down to the bone, and his blood was red as it welled up and dripped off his skin.</p><p>Doc Jane came over to him. &#x201c;Okay, let&#x2019;s get you to the sink.&#x201d;</p><p>To her credit, she didn&#x2019;t touch him on the arm or try to lead him with a push on his shoulder blade; she just loomed and pointed the way to Kohler-land.</p><p>He still didn&#x2019;t like anyone but Bella putting their hands on his body, although he had made some progress. Now, if the contact was unexpected, his first move wasn&#x2019;t going for a concealed weapon and capping whoever had let their palms do the walking.</p><p>When they were in front of the sink, Doc Jane cranked the thing&#x2019;s throttle over and fired it back so that there was a warm rush landing in the deep porcelain belly.</p><p>&#x201c;Under,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>He extended his arm and put his thumb into the hot water. The slice burned like a bitch, but he didn&#x2019;t wince. &#x201c;Let me guess. Bella asked you to come talk to me just now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nope.&#x201d; When he shot her a look, the good doctor shook her head. &#x201c;I examined her and the baby. That was it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, good. Because I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Had a feeling you&#x2019;d say that.&#x201d; Doc Jane crossed her arms over her chest and regarded him with a stare that made him want to build a brick wall between the two of them. Whether in a solid state or translucent as she was at the moment, it didn&#x2019;t matter. When you got eyeballed by the female like this, it was as if you&#x2019;d been sandblasted. No wonder she and V got along.</p><p>&#x201c;She did mention you won&#x2019;t feed from her.&#x201d;</p><p>Z shrugged. &#x201c;Nalla needs what her body can provide more than I do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not an either-or situation, though. Bella&#x2019;s young and healthy and she has great eating habits. And you&#x2019;ve let her feed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course. Anything for her. Her and her baby.&#x201d;</p><p>There was a long silence. Then, &#x201c;Maybe you want to talk to Mary?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;About what.&#x201d; He shut the water off and shook his palm out over the sink. &#x201c;Just because I&#x2019;m respectful of the demands on my <i>shellan</i>, you think I need a shrink? What the hell?&#x201d;</p><p>He snapped a paper towel free from the roll mounted under the cabinets and dried his hand.</p><p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s the salad for, Z?&#x201d; the doctor asked.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The salad. Who&#x2019;s it for?&#x201d;</p><p>He pulled out the trash bin and pitched the towel inside. &#x201c;Bella. It&#x2019;s for Bella. Look, no offense, but&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And when&#x2019;s the last time you ate?&#x201d;</p><p>He put his hands up, all &#x201c;Stop! In the Name of Love.&#x201d; &#x201c;Enough. I know you mean well, but I&#x2019;m a short fuse, and the last thing any of us needs is Vishous coming after me because I snapped at you. I get your point&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Look at your hand.&#x201d;</p><p>He glanced down. Blood was running from the pad of his thumb onto his wrist and his forearm. If he hadn&#x2019;t had a short-sleeved T-shirt on, the shit would have been pooling at his elbow. Instead, it was trickling onto the terra-cotta tile.</p><p>Doc Jane&#x2019;s voice was annoyingly level, her logic offensively sound. &#x201c;You are in a dangerous line of work where you rely on your body to do things that keep you from getting killed. You don&#x2019;t want to talk to Mary? Fine. But you need to make some concessions physically. That cut should have closed by now. It hasn&#x2019;t, and I&#x2019;m willing to bet it bleeds for the next hour or so.&#x201d; She shook her head. &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s my deal. Wrath&#x2019;s appointed me as the Brotherhood&#x2019;s personal physician. You screw around with eating and feeding and sleeping such that it impairs your performance, I will bench your ass.&#x201d;</p><p>Z stared at the glossy red droplets seeping up from the wound. The river of them went straight over the inch-wide black slave band that had been tattooed on his wrist nearly two hundred years ago. He had one on his other arm and another around his neck.</p><p>Reaching forward, he peeled off another section of paper towel. The blood wiped off just fine, but there was no getting rid of what his sick bitch Mistress had marked him with. The ink was imbedded in his tissue, put there to show that he was property to be used, not an individual to live.</p><p>For no good reason, he thought of Nalla&#x2019;s infant skin, so incredibly smooth and completely unmarred. Everyone remarked on how soft it was. Bella. All his brothers. All the <i>shellans</i> of the house. It was one of the first things they commented on when they held her. That and how she was like a down pillow, she was so huggable.</p><p>&#x201c;Have you ever tried to get those removed?&#x201d; Doc Jane said softly.</p><p>&#x201c;They can&#x2019;t be removed,&#x201d; he said briskly, dropping his hand. &#x201c;The ink has salt in it. It&#x2019;s permanent.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But have you ever tried? There are lasers now that&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d better go take care of this cut so I can finish here.&#x201d; He grabbed another paper towel. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll need some gauze and tape&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have that in my bag.&#x201d; She turned to go over to the table. &#x201c;I have everything&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, thanks, I&#x2019;ll take care of it myself.&#x201d;</p><p>Doc Jane stared up at him, her eyes clear. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care if you&#x2019;re independent. But stupidity I won&#x2019;t stand for. We clear? That bench has your name on it.&#x201d;</p><p>If she&#x2019;d been one of his brothers, he would have bared his fangs and hissed at her. But he couldn&#x2019;t do that to Doc Jane, and not just because she was a female. Thing was, there was nothing to push back at with her. She was just objective medical opinion.</p><p>&#x201c;We clear?&#x201d; she prompted, utterly unimpressed by how fierce he had to be looking.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. I hear you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He has these nightmares.... God, the nightmares.&#x201d;</p><p>Bella leaned down and stuffed the dirty diaper into the bin. On the way back up, she snagged another Huggies from under the dressing table and brought out the talc and the baby wipes. Palming Nalla&#x2019;s ankles, she hipped up her daughter&#x2019;s little butt, did a fast-and-dash sweep with the cloth, sprinkled some powder, then slid the fresh diaper into place.</p><p>From across the nursery, Phury&#x2019;s voice was low. &#x201c;Nightmares about being a blood slave?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Has to be it.&#x201d; She put Nalla&#x2019;s clean bottom down and taped up the sides of the Huggies. &#x201c;Because he won&#x2019;t talk to me about it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Has he been eating? Feeding?&#x201d;</p><p>Bella shook her head as she did up the snaps on Nalla&#x2019;s onesie. The thing was pastel pink and had a white skull and crossbones appliqu�d on it. &#x201c;Not much on the food and no on feeding. It&#x2019;s like ... I don&#x2019;t know, the day she was born, he seemed so amazed and engaged and happy. But then some kind of switch was triggered and he just closed up. It&#x2019;s almost as bad as it was in the beginning.&#x201d; She stared down at Nalla, who was patting at the pattern on her little chest. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry I asked you to come down here.... I just don&#x2019;t know what else to do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad you did.

In those twelve months, Einstein shattered many cherished scientific beliefs with five extraordinary papers that would establish him as the world's leading physicist. This book brings those papers together in an accessible format. The best-known papers are the two that founded special relativity: <i>On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies</i> and <i>Does the Inertia of a Body Depend on Its Energy Content?</i> In the former, Einstein showed that absolute time had to be replaced by a new absolute: the speed of light. In the second, he asserted the equivalence of mass and energy, which would lead to the famous formula <i>E = mc2</i><br><i> </i>.</p><br><p> The book also includes <i>On a Heuristic Point of View Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light</i>, in which Einstein challenged the wave theory of light, suggesting that light could also be regarded as a collection of particles. This helped to open the door to a whole new world--that of quantum physics. For ideas in this paper, he won the Nobel Prize in 1921.</p><br><p> The fourth paper also led to a Nobel Prize, although for another scientist, Jean Perrin. <i>On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in Stationary Liquids Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat</i> concerns the Brownian motion of such particles. With profound insight, Einstein blended ideas from kinetic theory and classical hydrodynamics to derive an equation for the mean free path of such particles as a function of the time, which Perrin confirmed experimentally. The fifth paper, <i>A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions</i>, was Einstein's doctoral dissertation, and remains among his most cited articles. It shows how to calculate Avogadro's number and the size of molecules.</p><br><p> These papers, presented in a modern English translation, are essential reading for any physicist, mathematician, or astrophysicist. Far more than just a collection of scientific articles, this book presents work that is among the high points of human achievement and marks a watershed in the history of science.</p><br><p> Coinciding with the 100th anniversary of the miraculous year, this new paperback edition includes an introduction by John Stachel, which focuses on the personal aspects of Einstein's youth that facilitated and led up to the miraculous year.</p></p><p><p>"It is particularly remarkable that a single physicist--Albert Einstein--has such extraordinarily deep perceptions of the workings of Nature that he laid foundation stones of . . .[the] twentieth-century revolutions [in physics] in the single year of 1905."<b>--From the foreword by Roger Penrose, Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford</b></p><b>John Stachel</b> is Professor of Physics Emeritus at Boston University, where he directs the Center for Einstein Studies. <b>Roger Penrose</b> is Emeritus Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford and holds a regular visiting appointment at the Pennsylvania State University, where he is Francis R.

Duncan Foley builds an understanding of the theory systematically, from first principles through the definition of central concepts to the development of important applications. All of the topics in the three volumes of <i>Capital</i> are included, providing the reader with a complete view of Marxist economics.</p><p>Foley begins with a helpful discussion of philosophical problems readers often encounter in tackling Marx, including questions of epistemology, explanation, prediction, determinism, and dialectics. In an original extension of theory, he develops the often neglected concept of the circuit of capital to analyze Marx's theory of the reproduction of capital. He also takes up central problems in the capitalist economy: equalization of the rates of profit (the "transformation problem"); productive and unproductive labor and the division of surplus value; and the falling rate of profit. He concludes with a discussion of the theory of capitalist crisis and of the relation of Marx's critique of capitalism to his conception of socialism.</p><p>Through a careful treatment of the theory of money in relation to the labor theory of value, Foley clarifies the relation of prices to value and of Marx's categories of analysis to conventional business and national income accounts, enabling readers to use Marx's theory as a tool for the analysis of practical problems. The text is closely keyed throughout to the relevant chapters in <i>Capital</i> and includes suggestions for further reading on the topics discussed.</p></p><p>Duncan K.

But Mildred also had two weaknesses: a yen for shiftless men, and an unreasoning devotion to a monstrous daughter. <br>Out of these elements, Cain creates a novel of acute social observation and devastating emotional violence, with a heroine whose ambitions and sufferings are never less than recognizable.James Mallahan Cain (1892-1977) was a first-rate writer of American hard-boiled crime fiction. Born in Baltimore, the son of the president of Washington College, Cain began his career as a reporter, serving in the American Expeditionary Force in World War I and writing for <i>The Cross of Lorraine</i>, the newspaper of the 79th Division. He returned from the war to embark on a literay career that included a professorship at St. John&#x2019;s College in Annapolis and a stint at <i>The New Yorker</i> as managing editor before he went to Hollywood as a script writer. Cain&#x2019;s famous first novel, <b>The Postman Always Rings Twice</b>, was published in 1934 when he was forty-two, and became an instant sensation. It was tried for obscenity in Boston and was said by Albert Camus to have inspired his own book, <b>The Stranger</b>. The infamous novel was staged in 1936, and filmed in 1946 and 1981. The story of a young hobo who has an affair with a married woman and plots with her to murder her husband and collect his insurance, <b>The Postman Always Rings Twice</b> is a benchmark of classic crime fiction and film noir. Two of Cain&#x2019;s other novels, <b>Mildred Pierce</b> (1941) and <b>Double Indemnity</b> (1943), were also made into film noir classics. In 1974, James M. Cain was awarded the Grand Master Award by the Mystery Writers of America. Cain published eighteen books in all and was working on his autobiography at the time of his death.</p><h2>The Journey: How to live by Faith in an Uncertain World</h2><p><p>Billy Graham is respected and loved around the world. And this work is his magnum opus, the culmination of a lifetime of experience and ministry! </p><p>Chapter by chapter, Graham leads us on a journey in faith. We learn about God and his purpose for our lives; who Jesus is and what he has done for us. We are reminded of the things God has given us to live successfully: the Bible, the privilege of prayer, fellowship and the church, and the Holy Spirit. We learn to deal with challenges along the way: temptation; wrong thoughts and motives; emotions that can defeat us; habits that destroy our spirit, and what to do when life turns against us. And we are given practical advice on knowing God's will, making right decision, strengthening our marriages, being wise parents, and using our gifts to share Christ with others. </p><p>With insight that only comes from a life spent with God, <em>The Journey</em> is filled with wisdom, encouragement, hope, and inspiration for anyone who wants to live a happier, more fulfilling life.</p></p><p>Billy Graham, world-renowned preacher, evangelist, and author has delivered the gospel message to more people face-to-face than anyone in history and has ministered on every continent of the world in more than 185 countries. Millions have read his inspirational classics, including Angels, Peace with God, The Holy Spirit, Hope for the Troubled Heart, How to Be Born Again, The Journey, Nearing Home, and The Reason for My Hope.Made even stronger by Reathel Bean's resonance and genuine connection, Billy Graham's words have authority, compassion, and a groundedness that only a lifetime of humanitarian service could create. During this powerful program the fading tradition of trusting God and accepting His guidance sounds appealing again. Graham says that when we trust in God, we don't have to be alone and we don't have to be controlled by personal tragedies and losses. Graham deeply understands so many realms of life--from family and community to challenges in the broader world arena. He urges us to remember that we are more than sophisticated animals--we have the capacity to find meaning and sustenance in God's love and omnipotence.

Drawing on unexplored archives and personal testimonies gathered from across Russia and Georgia, this is the first full-scale biography of the Soviet dictator in twenty years.<br></p><p><br></p><p><br><br>Service describes in unprecedented detail the first half of Stalin's life--his childhood in Georgia as the son of a violent, drunkard father and a devoted mother; his education and religious training; and his political activity as a young revolutionary. No mere messenger for Lenin, Stalin was a prominent activist long before the Russian Revolution. Equally compelling is the depiction of Stalin as Soviet leader. Service recasts the image of Stalin as unimpeded despot; his control was not limitless. And his conviction that enemies surrounded him was not entirely unfounded.<br></p><p><br></p><p><br><br>Stalin was not just a vengeful dictator but also a man fascinated by ideas and a voracious reader of Marxist doctrine and Russian and Georgian literature as well as an internationalist committed to seeing Russia assume a powerful role on the world stage. In examining the multidimensional legacy of Stalin, Service helps explain why later would-be reformers--such as Khrushchev and Gorbachev--found the Stalinist legacy surprisingly hard to dislodge. <br></p><p><br></p><p><br><br>Rather than diminishing the horrors of Stalinism, this is an account all the more disturbing for presenting a believable human portrait. Service's lifetime engagement with Soviet Russia has resulted in the most comprehensive and compelling portrayal of Stalin to date.<br></p></p><p>Robert Service is a Fellow of the British Academy and Professor of Russian History at Oxford University.<i>Stalin</i>, a sequel to Mr. Service's <i>Lenin: A Biography</i>, presents a richly documented, highly persuasive portrait of the man who transformed the Soviet Union into a modern military-industrial power, terrorized millions and ruled over an empire that would have been the envy of the czars... Brick by brick, Mr. Service constructs a solid, accessible work that does as much as one book can to explain Stalin as a human being, and as the architect of a system that still weighs heavy on millions of citizens in the former Soviet Union. (William Grimes <i>New York Times</i> 2005-04-13)<br><br>[An] excellent new biography...Robert Service paints a picture of a warped monster of a man, insatiable in his pursuit of power, ruthless in his treatment of real and imagined rivals, remorseless in his murder of millions. Service's innovation is to reveal Stalin's frailty--above all, his capacity for miscalculation. He made no blunder costlier than that of June 1941; yet he himself got off scot-free. (Niall Ferguson <i>New York Times Book Review</i> 2005-06-12)<br><br>Service has written an unhurried, richly detailed and rigorously researched book, anchored in hundreds of sources--a vast but cleanly structured text, polished, fluent and brisk...Service gives us a portrait of a paranoid and murderous despot, not a one-dimensional, cartoonish baddie...Service greatly advances our understanding by deftly fusing the tale of the man with that of the doctrine to which he was fanatically beholden and the ethos and practices of the tiny underground party. (Leon Aron <i>Washington Post</i> 2005-04-17)<br><br>In Service's eyes, Stalin remains ruthless, cunning and murderous. But a richer and more complex individual emerges--and a more human one. Stalin is shown as lover, husband and father. A man who wrote poetry and loved singing. A serious communist political thinker and the best-read Russian leader since Catherine the Great...[Service] has written a masterly book, with great erudition, style and wit. Although there are still some Soviet-era archives that remain closed, this biography will surely stand the test of time. (Stefan Wagstyl <i>Financial Times</i> 2004-10-23)<br><br>This is effectively the first full biography since perestroika to encompass the economic, political, diplomatic, military, administrative and, above all, ideological dimensions, as well as the personal aspects of Stalin's colossal life. Gritty and unshowy, but enlightened by Service's compelling characterisation, magisterial analysis and dry wit, this outstanding biography of lightly worn authority, wide research and superb intuition will be read for decades. (Simon Sebag Montefiore <i>The Sunday Times</i> 2004-10-10)<br><br>A common perception of Stalin is that of an oafish backroom bureaucrat who bludgeoned his way to the heights of power. But this image does not do justice to the multi-faceted and fascinating person who emerges in this latest biography. Drawing on fresh archive material, historian Robert Service lays the man bare and places him within the context of his times. He paints a picture of a talented politician who was driven by a severe personality disorder to behave in the way he did...Humanising him, Service believes, will help to identify future tyrants. Here he has struck the right balance and produced an intellectually cogent and highly readable account. (Gavin Engelbrecht <i>Northern Echo</i> 2005-02-01)<br><br>Robert Service's brilliant biography of Stalin is a major work: the fruit of long research, profound insight and understanding of his subject. It offers a truly rounded and thoroughly readable portrait of this monstrous figure. (Andrew Roberts <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>)<br><br>In the course of this engrossing and well-researched book, Stalin emerges as a fascinating, complex figure. (Andrew Roberts <i>Daily Telegraph</i> 2004-10-09)<br><br>In his new biography of the Soviet dictator, Robert Service has given the most convincing description yet of how Stalin's insecure Georgian childhood fashioned his psychology. At key points in the book, we are reminded of Stalin's duality--on the one hand he was a proud Caucasian toughie who organized bank robberies and could drink spirits all night. On the other, he was a man who aspired to understand and interpret (crassly) high art and politics...This is the first serious political biography of Stalin since the opening of the archives in Moscow and St. Petersburg in the 1990s and Service has made good use of them. (Misha Glenny <i>Irish Times</i> 2004-11-27)<br><br>A profound and readable reassessment of the Soviet dictator... Service paints a picture of a ruthless man absorbed in the pursuit of politics, widely read, perceptive, cunning and, despite a self-effacing and isolated persona, the stuff of leadership... Stalin was no fool; he could scarcely have become dictator of a vast nation if he had been. Yet his contemporaries, and many historians since, have underestimated him. Service makes sense of Stalin's achievements by making us take him seriously... Stalin's power at its peak was immense and daunting. Service reminds us that a quarter of Russians recently polled put the Stalin years top of the list of periods in Russian history they most admired... This shrewd biography helps us understand clearly and dispassionately why not everyone remembers Stalin as a murderous ogre.

The readings are drawn from a diverse selection of Third World and Western thinkers, both historical and contemporary. "Post-colonialism" is taken by the editors to include Third World and diasporic experience; like "colonialism," it is understood to contain a complex set of cultural, ethnographic, political, and economic processes and conflicts.<br><br>This volume explores such issues as the nature of colonized cultures and anti-colonial resistance; subaltern historiography; constructions of Western subjectivity, knowledge, and gender; the formation of post-colonial intellectuals; the metropolitan institutionalization of post-colonialism; neo-colonialism; and the nature of minority and post-colonial identity and discourse. One section is devoted to the application of theoretical formulations to cultural criticism, and contains a number of textual analyses. A general introduction to the volume as well as introductions to each section provide historical, theoretical, and poltical contexts for the readings.

Always controversial, and ever more polarizing in today&#39;s political climate, social problems take up a huge chunk of our cultural bandwidth. Rather than simply presenting social problems as a series of facts, the sixth edition of Social Problems focuses on how people construct problems, and how they develop potential solutions, based on their political attitudes. Analyzing issues from liberal, radical-left, conservative, and libertarian points of view, author John Macionis explains why people disagree about what the problems are, and how one person&#39;s &#34;problem&#34; may well be another&#39;s &#34;solution.&#34; Once you understand how social problems are defined politically, you&#39;ll be able to develop your own positions, and you&#39;ll have the knowledge you need to engage in solving social problems through activism and political discussion.

Rough never expected to write a book about sex, but life handed her a revelation too vital to ignore. As an American parent grappling with concerns about raising children in a society steeped in stereotypes and sexual shame, she couldn't quite picture how to teach the facts of life with a fearless, easygoing, positive attitude. Then a job change relocated her family to Amsterdam, where she soon witnessed the relaxed and egalitarian sexual attitudes of the Dutch. There, she discovered, children learn from babyhood that bodies are normal, the world's best sex ed begins in kindergarten, cooties are a foreign concept, puberty is no big surprise, and questions about sex are welcome at the dinner table.<br><br> In <i>Beyond Birds and Bees, </i>Rough reveals how although normalizing human sexuality may sound risky, doing so actually prevents unintended consequences, leads to better health and success for our children, and lays the foundation for a future of gender equality. Exploring how the Dutch example translates to American life, Rough highlights a growing wave of ambitious American parents, educators, and influencers poised to transform sex ed--and our society--for the better, and shows how families everywhere can give a modern lift to the birds and bees. <br><br> Down to earth and up to the minute with our profound new cultural conversations about gender, sex, power, autonomy, diversity, and consent, Rough's careful research and engaging storytelling illuminate a forward path for a groundbreaking generation of Americans who want clear examples and actionable steps for how to support children's sexual development--and overall wellbeing--from birth onward at home, in schools, and across our evolving culture.<br><br></p><p>Bonnie J.

Internationally known instructor, coach and judge Charles de Kunffy details a program of exercises that will enable horses at all levels of dressage and combined training to improve their performance as equine athletes. Unlike other dressage books that explain how to exercise a horse in order to ride a standardized test, this book explains how such exercises can and should be used to increase performance ability, suspension, collection and changes of gaits through true patterns and counter patterns that are accompanied by diagrams and demonstration photographs. Those who have attended Charles de Kunffy&#39;s clinics know that horses inevitably and rapidly improve under his guidance and that riders themselves improve as well. And those encountering him for the first time will experience in this, his third dressage book, what others already know: Here is a horseman of uncommon intelligence and wit who expresses himself clearly, simply and elegantly.About the Author Charles de Kunffy is known throughout the world as an author, lecturer, coach and judge (AHSA--I; FEI--C). From his home in California he travels to teach training courses for teachers and judges and also to give clinics in the United States and abroad. His two earlier books, Dressage Questions Answered and Creative Horsemanship, have been a mainstay of equestrian literature for more than a decade. Currently he is revising and updating them for another generation of readers.</p><h2>Out of Place: A Memoir</h2><p><b>Out of Place</b> is an extraordinary story of exile, a narrative of many departures, a celebration of an irrecoverable past. A fatal medical diagnosis in 1991 convinced Edward Said that he should leave a record of where he was born and spent his childhood, and so with this memoir he rediscovers the Arab landscape of his early years--"the many places and people [who] no longer exist . . . Essentially a lost world." Vast changes occurred as Palestine became Israel, Lebanon was transformed by twenty years of civil war, and the colonial Egypt of King Farouk disappeared forever by 1952. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Born in Jerusalem in 1935, Said was the only son in a prosperous family of five children. His ferociously demanding father upheld many Victorian values and ideals, and his adoring mother inspired his love of music, theater, and literature. His aunt Nabiha gave him his first sense of what it meant to leave Palestine, something never discussed by the family. Said writes with great passion and wit about his family and his friends--from schools in Cairo and summers in the mountains above Beirut to, as he grew older, camp in Maine, boarding school in Massachusetts, and college at Princeton University. Underscoring all is the confusion of identity as Said had to come to terms with the dissonance of being an American citizen, a Christian and a Palestinian, and, ultimately, an outsider.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Out of Place</b> reveals an unimaginable world of rich, colorful characters, of exotic eastern landscapes. Lyrical and beautifully crafted, it is often extremely frank as well as intimate and humorous. Said has exposed a most personal past, letting us observe the people who formed him and who enabled him to triumph as one of the most important intellectuals of our time.<br><br><b>Out of Place</b> won the New Yorker Book Award for nonfiction in 2000.</p><p>Edward Said is one of the most celebrated cultural critics of the postwar world. Of his many books of literary, political, and philosophical criticism, <i>Orientalism</i>--a brilliant analysis of how Europe came to dominate the Orient through the creation of the myth of the exotic East--and the monumental <i>Culture and Imperialism</i> are the best known. His books have redefined readers' understanding of the impact of European imperialism upon the shape of modern culture. Said's career as a thinker spans literature, politics, music, philosophy, and history. As a dispossessed Palestinian growing up in the Middle East and subsequently living in the USA, he has witnessed the impact of the Second World War upon the Arab world, the dissolution of Palestine and the birth of Israel, the rise of Nasser and the PLO, the Lebanese Civil War, and the faltering peace process of the 1990s. As a result, the publication of Said's memoirs, <i>Out of Place</i>, is a particularly significant event. The book offers a fascinating account of the personal development of a critic and thinker who has straddled the divide between East and West, and in the process has redefined Western perceptions of the East and of the plight of Palestinian people.<p> However, as the title suggests, Said's memoir is a far more ambivalent and at times personally painful account of his early years in Palestine, Egypt, and Lebanon, as well as the often paralyzing embrace of his loving but overbearing parents. Said's memoirs are powerfully informed by his sense of personally, geographically, and linguistically "always being out of place." Born to Christian parents and caught between expressing himself in Arabic, English, and French, he evokes a vivid, but often very unhappy, portrait of growing up in Cairo and Lebanon under the crushing weight of his emotionally intense and ambitious family. The early sections of the book paint a poignant picture of the oppressive regime established over the awkward, painfully uncertain young Edward by his loving mother and expectant, unforgiving father, both of whom cast the longest emotional shadows over the book. Those expecting an account of Said's subsequent intellectual development will be disappointed; apart from the final 50 pages, which deal with Said's education at Princeton and Harvard, <i>Out of Place</i> is, as Said himself says, primarily "a record of an essentially lost or forgotten world, my early life." It is this carefully disclosed record that accounts for Said's deeply ambivalent relationship with both his family and the Palestinian cause. Composed in the light of serious illness, <i>Out of Place</i> is an elegantly written reflection on a life that has movingly come to terms with "being not quite right and out of place." <i>--Jerry Brotton, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>"Absorbing. . . . An almost Proustian portrait." --<i>The New York Times</i><br><br>"Said has turned the writing of a memoir itself into perhaps the most profound type of homecoming a perennial exile can know." --<i>The Village Voice Literary Supplement</i><br><br>"Engrossing. . . . [Said has] an almost Proustian feel for smells, sounds, sights, and telling anecdotes." --<i>The New York Review of Books</i><br><br>"If autobiography is above all a means of explaining one's self to oneself, then <b>Out of Place</b> . . . must be seen as a triumph." --<i>The Boston Globe</i></p><h2>Hebrew for Life: Strategies for Learning, Retaining, and Reviving Biblical Hebrew</h2><p>Three experienced biblical language professors inspire readers to learn, retain, and use Hebrew for ministry, setting them on a lifetime journey of reading and loving the Hebrew Bible.

For in his lyrical, sorrowful account of a man's death and its impact on his family, Agee painstakingly created a small world of domestic happiness and then showed how quickly and casually it could be destroyed. <br><br>On a sultry summer night in 1915, Jay Follet leaves his house in Knoxville, Tennessee, to tend to his father, whom he believes is dying. The summons turns out to be a false alarm, but on his way back to his family, Jay has a car accident and is killed instantly. Dancing back and forth in time and braiding the viewpoints of Jay's wife, brother, and young son, Rufus, Agee creates an overwhelmingly powerful novel of innocence, tenderness, and loss that should be read aloud for the sheer music of its prose.<br><br>"An utterly individual and original book...one of the most deeply worked out expressions of human feeling that I have ever read."--Alfred Kazin, New York Times Book Review<br><br>"It is, in the full sense, poetry....The language of the book, at once luminous and discreet...remains in the mind."--New Republic<br><br>"People I know who read <b>A Death in the Family</b> forty years ago still talk about it.

Great organizations inspire the three most powerful motives for work&#x2014;play, purpose, and potential&#x2014;and eliminate the three most destructive&#x2014;emotional pressure, economic pressure, and inertia. They create total motivation (or ToMo, for short). Total motivation cultures create the highest-performing employees and the most adaptive organizations.</p><p>Authors Neel Doshi and Lindsay McGregor show that extraordinary performance at companies like Southwest Airlines, Starbucks, Apple, and Whole Foods comes from cultures that inspire total motivation.

Authors David R. Shaffer and Katherine Kipp provide you with a current and comprehensive overview of child and adolescent development, written in clear, concise language that talks &#34;to&#34; you rather than &#34;at&#34; you. The authors also focus on application showing how theories and research apply to real-life settings. As a result, you will gain an understanding of developmental principles that will help you in your roles as parents, teachers, nurses, day-care workers, pediatricians, psychologists, or in any other capacity by which you may one day influence the lives of developing persons.

Shaffer is a Professor and Undergraduate Coordinator of Psychology at the University of Georgia, where he focuses on the Social and Life-Span Developmental Psychology Programs. He has been teaching courses in human development to graduate and undergraduate students for nearly 30 years. His many research articles have concerned such topics as altruism, attitudes and persuasion, moral development, sex roles and social behavior, self-disclosure, and social psychology and the law. He has also served as associate editor for the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, and Journal of Personality."The writing is so clear and straightforward that students would not get confused. It is clear that the authors were thoughtful about how to present the material to students. The inclusion of recent research from cognitive neuroscience is another positive aspect. The wealth of resources available to students and instructors would allow me recommend this textbook to a colleague who is teaching both childhood and adolescence."<br><br>"This is an excellent textbook that takes a topical rather than a chronological approach to child and adolescent development. This topical approach makes it much more effective in fitting it into a single semester, with the idea of covering one topic each week throughout the semester. The coverage is detailed and provides sufficient depth that students can really get a basic understanding of the key concepts for the course. Also, the built-in Concept Checks throughout the text help students determine whether or not they have mastered key concepts from one section before they move onto the next section of the material."<br><br>"It is a well-written text that is organized similarly to most developmental psychology texts. The level of difficulty is appropriate for undergraduates. It is a very solid text."</p><h2>To Build a Fire and Other Stories (Bantam Classics)</h2><p><p><i>To Build A Fire and Other Stories</i> is the most comprehensive and wide-ranging collection of Jack London's short stories available in paperback.

With its purloined jewels, its conniving, resilient, mercenary heroine, and its partiality for the human spectacle in all its complexity, The Eustace Diamonds is a splendid example of Trollope&#39;s art at its most assured.<p><strong>Anthony Trollope </strong>(1815-1882) grew up in London.

His first novel was published in 1847 while he was working in Ireland as a surveyor for the General Post Office. He wrote series of books set in the English countryside as well as those set in the political life, works that show great psychological penetration. One of his greatest strengths was his ability to re-create in his fiction his own vision of the social structures of Victorian England.

Greear pastors. Big givers. Key volunteers. Some of his best leaders and friends. And that&#x2019;s exactly how he wants it to be.</p> <p>When Jesus gave his disciples the Great Commission, he revealed that the key for reaching the world with the gospel is found in sending, not gathering. Though many churches focus time and energy on attracting people and counting numbers, the real mission of the church isn&#x2019;t how many people you can gather. It&#x2019;s about training up disciples and then sending them out. The true measure of success for a church should be its sending capacity, not its seating capacity.</p> <p>But there is a cost to this. To see ministry multiply, we must release the seeds God has placed in our hands. And to do that, we must ask ourselves whether we are concerned more with building our kingdom or God&#x2019;s.</p> <p>In <em>Gaining By Losing</em>, J.D. Greear unpacks ten plumb lines that you can use to reorient your church&#x2019;s priorities around God&#x2019;s mission to reach a lost world. The good news is that you don&#x2019;t need to choose between gathering or sending. Effective churches can, and must, do both.</p></p><p><p>J.D.

In the final decade of the nineteenth century, the Welsh writer produced a seminal body of tales of occult horror, spiritual and physical corruption, and malignant survivals from the primeval past which horrified and scandalised-late-Victorian readers. Machen's "weird fiction" has influenced generations of storytellers, from H. P. Lovecraft to Guillermo Del Toro-and it remains no less unsettling today.<br><br>This new collection, which includes the complete novel <em>The Three Impostors</em> as well as such celebrated tales as <em>The Great God Pan</em> and <em>The White People</em>, constitutes the most comprehensive critical edition of Machen yet to appear. In addition to the core late-Victorian horror classics, a selection of lesser-known prose poems and later tales helps to present a fuller picture of the development of Machen's weird vision.

White and Elizabeth Lawrence--A Friendship in Letters</h2><p>A legendary editor at <i>The New Yorker</i> during its first thirty-four years, Katharine S. White was also a great garden enthusiast. In March 1958 she began publishing her popular column, "Onward and Upward in the Garden." Her first column elicited loads of fan mail, but one letter in particular caught her attention. From Elizabeth Lawrence, a noted southern garden writer, it was filled with suggestions and encouragement. When Katharine wrote back her appreciation, she reported on her Maine garden and discussed the plants and books that interested her. Thus began a correspondence that would last for almost twenty years, until Katharine's death in 1977. <br><br><i>Two Gardeners</i> is a collection of these luminous letters, edited and introduced by Emily Herring Wilson. The letters bring to life the unique epistolary friendship between two intelligent women, the "formidable" Mrs. White and the "shy" Miss Lawrence, both avid gardeners and readers, both at a stage of life when to make a new friend was rare indeed: when they first wrote to one another, Katharine was sixty-two, Elizabeth, fifty-four.<br><br>More than 150 letters went back and forth during the course of their correspondence, though Katharine and Elizabeth would meet face-to-face only once. Whether talking about gardens or books, friends or family, each held a special place in the other's life.<br><br>Illustrated with photographs of both Katharine White and Elizabeth Lawrence, their families, gardens, and houses, this book is a special treat for gardeners, literature lovers, and anyone who delights in reading about women's friendships.</p><p>Emily Herring Wilson is a writer, lecturer, and novice gardener living in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

Some readers wrote to ask the name of the <br>writer, identified only as K.S.W. (Someone with a near-perfect memory might <br>have realized that "K.S.W." was "K.S.A.," who had written light verse about <br>the "Seductive Spring Seed Catalogue" in a March 1926 New Yorker, when <br>she was Katharine S. Angell and a new staff member.) One reader who did <br>know the identity of the writer was Elizabeth Lawrence, a lifelong reader of <br>The New Yorker. Her fan letter to Katharine a month or so after the <br>appearance of the review is the first letter in the following section.<br><br> After a dozen letters between "Mrs. White" and "Miss Lawrence," <br>Katharine and Elizabeth settled into a first-name basis. Elizabeth kept up a <br>steady flow of information on nurseries and garden books and thus called <br>forth Katharine"s repeated expressions of appreciation and more questions. <br>Elizabeth clearly enjoyed researching any topics that were introduced, and <br>she was glad to have Katharine"s records of bloom dates in Maine. For more <br>than three decades Eizabeth had been making notes on index cards about <br>what was going on in her garden&#x2014;and in the gardens of others. The <br>unexpected availability of such a fine compatriot as Elizabeth must have <br>confirmed the rightness of Katharine"s decision to follow her first review with a <br>series of pieces, to be presented each time under the title "Onward and <br>Upward in the Garden." She hoped to publish them twice a year, and in 1959 <br>and 1960 she succeeded. In March 1960 she received a letter from the <br>publisher Alfred Knopf, proposing that she write a book, an idea that she told <br>him she would "ponder."<br><br> The letters going back and forth between Charlotte, North <br>Carolina, and North Brooklin, Maine (and New York City and Sarasota, <br>Florida, when the Whites traveled) were hardy perennials. Feelings began to <br>jostle alongside facts as the two women exchanged anecdotes and kept up <br>one another"s spirits. By early spring 1961, Katharine&#x2014;who had insisted that <br>she was an editor, not a writer&#x2014;had published some 100 pages of her garden <br>pieces in The New Yorker. She began to enjoy including some of her own <br>memories in her discussions of flowers, recalling happy summers as a child <br>when she and her sister picked water lilies on Lake Chocorua in New <br>Hampshire.<br><br> Elizabeth, for her part, was also publishing her gardening column <br>every Sunday in the Charlotte Observer. Although she worked on two or three <br>book manuscripts at a time, the newspaper column gave her the greatest <br>pleasure, always producing a flurry of letters. "I wish you lived next door," <br>Elizabeth wrote to Katharine, "I would fill your garden up."</p><h2>Listen to This (4th Edition)</h2><p><i>For courses in Music Appreciation</i> <br>&nbsp;<br> <b>Listen to the music.

The CCRT Method is a research-supported, easily operationalized, valid, and reliable form of conducting a strongly interactive form of brief therapy. The CCRT method offers symptom relief and limited but significant character change in a 16-session format that focuses on and helps the client work through one crucial, circumscribed area of maladaptive personality style. Small changes in this one behavioral theme, or dimension, have been seen to be associated with larger more pervasive shifts in functioning. After presenting general background about the BPPs and specific discussion of the CCRT rationale and process, author Howard E. Book offers the reader a unique analysis of CCRT therapy in action. In an extended clinical vignette, the reader may follow therapist and client in a step-by-step manner, from initial session; to therapist formation, articulation, and presentation of the CCRT; through the tripartite 16-session course of therapy itself; and finally to termination and follow-up.</p><p></p><h2>Listen and Sing: Lessons in Ear-Training and Sight-Singing</h2><p>This text systematically develops the aural, vocal, and rhythmic skills of all music majors.

And it just keeps getting better.</p><p>Grease up your favorite Pole... During the past two months, we have received offers from publishers in Poland, Russia and Latvia to do translations of the Guide in each of their own countries. The Hebrew edition of the Guide has been sitting on top of the bestseller lists in Israel, and the UK edition will soon be on sale in England. This is a very kind reception for a book that every major American publishing company refused to print only five years ago. Many thanks to those of you who have supported the Guide here in America. I love hearing from you and hope you will email me with your comments or suggestions. (Contact info is in the book).

Combining thoughtful interpretation with contemporary insight for daily living, James Montgomery Boice explains the meaning of the text and relates the text&#39;s concerns to the church, Christianity, and the world in which we live. Whether used for devotions, preaching, or teaching, this authoritative and thought-provoking series will appeal to a wide range of readers, from serious Bible students to interested laypersons.</p><p>Psalms: An Expositional Commentary accents the spiritual riches of the Psalter and establishes the point of convergence between the modern reader and the ancient songs of God&#39;s people. It is written for personal meditation and for fruitful teaching and preaching.James Montgomery Boice (1938 - 2000) was senior pastor of Tenth Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was also president and cofounder of the Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals, the parent organization of The Bible Study Hour on which Boice was a speaker for more than thirty years.</p><h2>Legends: Women Who Have Changed the World Through the Eyes of Great Women Writers</h2><p>Fifty essays celebrate the lives and contributions of a remarkable group of women, including Rachel Carson, Anne Frank, Zora Neale Hurston, Jackie Onassis, Georgia O&#39;Keefe, and Princess Diana</p><p>Although readers may quibble over how "legendary" a few of these subjects are or the greatness of some of their literary portrayers, this glossy tome deserves readers' attention. Brief, punchy text is paired with arresting black-and-white photos of a melange of remarkable women, such as Frida Kahlo, Aung San Suu Kyi, Rachel Carson, Margaret Thatcher, Golda Meir, Marilyn Monroe, and Josephine Baker. The result is an unholy, but thoroughly enjoyable, jostling throng where sex symbols rub elbows with world leaders and artists spill drinks on reformers.<p> Alma Guillermoprieto emblazons the later years of mercurial modern dance pioneer Martha Graham's life. Once a dance student at Graham's vaunted studio, she remembers that "as Martha wove through our ranks she would snarl, and pinch and slap us, evidently enraged by our sloppy posture, our dishevelment, our general lack of presence." Camille Paglia talks of what Amelia Earhart meant to her as an American teenager in the early 1960s, railing against restrictive sex roles while "marooned in a desert of perky blondes." Cynthia Ozick takes aim at Gertrude Stein, Joan Didion at Georgia O'Keefe, and Diane Ackerman at Beryl Markham. Margeretta Mitchell recalls photographer Imogen Cunningham striding San Francisco in her beaded cap and white bangs, proclaiming by her acts "that it was possible to grow old working; to maintain interest in life; to be wholly oneself." Far from being fluff, many of these excerpts from longer writings are as provocative and engaging as the legends they embellish. <i>--Francesca Coltrera</i></p>With such noted writers as Joan Didion, Mary Jo Salter, Alice Walker and Gloria Steinem, this compilation of images and words commemorating some of the world's most powerful women is invaluable. Legends: Women Who Have Changed the World Through the Eyes of Great Women Writers, edited by John Miller, celebrates eminent women like Anna Pavlova, Jane Goodall, Mother Theresa, Oprah, Frida Kahlo and Virginia Woolf from the perspectives of other women luminaries. Brief biographies of the 50 women featured are provided at the end. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Understanding Post-Tonal Music</h2><p><i>Understanding Post-Tonal Music</i> explores the compositional and musical processes of twentieth-century post-tonal music. The book is intended for undergraduate or general graduate courses on the theory and analysis of twentieth-century music. The aim of the book is to increase the accessibility of post-tonal music by providing students with tools for understanding issues like pitch organization, rhythm and meter, form, texture, and aesthetics. By presenting the music first and then deriving the theory, Understanding Post-Tonal Music leads students to greater understanding and appreciation of this challenging and important repertoire.</p><p></p><h2>The Narrative of Sojourner Truth (Dover Thrift Editions: Black History)</h2><p>This inspiring memoir, first published in 1850, recounts the struggles of a distinguished African-American abolitionist and champion of women&#39;s rights. Sojourner Truth tells of her life in slavery, her self-liberation, and her travels across America in pursuit of racial and sexual equality. Essential reading for students of American history.</p><p>&#34; Washington deserves out gratitude for reclaiming Truth and shedding light on the most enigmatic black woman of the 19th century.&#34; --Darlene Clark Hine, Michigan State University<p>One of the most famous and admired African-American women in U.S. history, Sojourner Truth sang, preached, and debated at camp meetings across the country, led by her devotion to the antislavery movement and her ardent pursuit of women's rights. Born into slavery in 1797, Truth fled from bondage some 30 years later to become a powerful figure in the progressive movements reshaping American society.<br>This remarkable narrative, first published in 1850, offers a rare glimpse into the little-documented world of Northern slavery. Truth recounts her life as a slave in rural New York, her separation from her family, her religious conversion, and her life as a traveling preacher during the 1840s. A spellbinding orator and implacable prophet, she also describes her work as a social reformer, counselor of former slaves, and sponsor of a black migration to the West.<br>Frederick Douglass described her message as a "strange compound of wit and wisdom, of wild enthusiasm, and flint-like common sense."</p><p></p></p><h2>The Bible--God&#39;s Word for the Biblically-Inept</h2><p>Learning about the sacred events that the Bible encompasses has never been easier. Best-selling author Larry Richards takes the Bible to a new level, a level of comprehension and Biblical satisfaction.</p><p>The series of which this is the third volume (Revelation and Daniel were published in 1998) takes advantage of the popularity of the "Idiots" and "Dummies" books, which attempt to explain a subject to nonspecialists. The goal of the series is to make learning the Bible simple and fun. The text briefly summarizes the content of each book of the Bible and emphasizes major theological concepts. Illustrations and quotations from other writers are scattered throughout. Each chapter concludes with study questions and a "Chapter Wrap-Up." A sidebar on every page contains definitions of vocabulary used in the text, scripture references, and keys to the structure of the text. Reading the "Big Picture" summaries throughout the book, one could get a fair idea of the flow of the books of the Bible. However, certain problems make this a less-than-ideal guide. Richards takes a conservative viewpoint and seldom presents opposing ideas. He introduces later theological terminology (such as Adam and Eve's "sin nature"), which may obscure rather than illuminate. Those who share the author's assumptions and are seeking a guided tour of the Bible may find this volume (and series) helpful. Not a high-priority purchase.?Craig W. Beard, Univ. of Alabama at Birmingham Lib.<br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Seeing Voices: A Journey into the World of the Deaf</h2><p>Oliver Sacks has been described (by <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>) as "one of the great clinical writers of the 20th century," and his books, including the medical classics <i>Migraine</i> and <i>Awakenings</i>, have been widely praised by critics from W. H. Auden to Harold Pinter to Doris Lessing. In his last book, <i>The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat</i>, Dr. Sacks undertook a fascinating journey into the world of the neurologically impaired, an exploration that Noel Perrin in the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> called "wise, compassionate, and very literate . . . the kind that restore(s) one's faith in humanity."<br><br>Now, with <i>Seeing Voices</i>, Dr. Sacks takes us into the world of the deaf, a world he explores with the same passion and insight that have illuminated other human conditions for his readers everywhere. <i>Seeing Voices</i> is a journey: a journey first into the history of deaf people, the (often outrageous) ways in which they were seen and treated in the past, and the new understanding that started to dawn in the eighteenth century; and a journey into the present situation of the deaf&#x2014;a situation which, all too often, is still one of misunderstanding and mistreatment.<br><br>Dr. Sacks writes of how he has come to see deaf people "in a new light, as a people, with a distinctive language, sensibility, and culture of their own." Indeed, it is only in the last ten years that the extraordinary and beautiful visual-gestural language of the deaf&#x2014;Sign&#x2014;has been fully recognized <i>as</i> a language, as linguistically complete, rich, and expressive as any spoken language, a language with its own distinctive basis in the brain. The one overwhelming peril for the deaf is to be kept from achieving language competence of any kind, to be denied access to both Sign and speech, and that tragedy is completely preventable by early exposure to Sign.<br><br>Sign is also social and cultural. It lies at the heart of the many manifestions of "deaf consciousness" in the past twenty years, among them the remarkable uprising of the deaf students at Gallaudet University in 1988. The revolt gained international attention and showed the world decisively that deaf people have "come of age" and no longer want to be treated as "disabled." Dr. Sacks gives a vivid personal account of the revolt and ponders its implications for the future. All his encounters in the course of this exhilarating journey raise issues of surprising depth and richness which, though of paramount interest to deaf people and all concerned with them, also extend powerfully to the human condition in general.</p><p>"This book will shake your preconceptions about the deaf, about language and about thought--. Sacks [is] one of the finest and most thoughtful writers of our time."--"Los Angeles Times Book Review <br>Like The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, this is a fascinating voyage into a strange and wonderful land, a provocative meditation on communication, biology, adaptation, and culture. In Seeing Voices, Oliver Sacks turns his attention to the subject of deafness, and the result is a deeply felt portrait of a minority struggling for recognition and respect--a minority with its own rich, sometimes astonishing, culture and unique visual language, an extraordinary mode of communication that tells us much about the basis of language in hearing people as well. Seeing Voices is, as Studs Terkel has written, "an exquisite, as well as revelatory, work."<b>Dr. Oliver Sacks</b> was born in London in 1933 and was educated in London, Oxford, California, and New York. His concern has always been with individuals, as they cope with extraordinary neurological difficulties, and lately this concern has widened to embrace communities, such as the deaf, and their collective and creative adaptations to biological predicaments. Dr. Sacks lives in New York, where he is Professor of Neurology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.</p><h2>The Oxford Companion to World Mythology</h2><p>Cave paintings at Lascaux, France and Altamira, Spain, fraught with expression thousands of years later; point to an early human desire to form a cultural identity. In the <em>Oxford Companion to World Mythology</em>, David Leeming explores the role of mythology, or myth-logic, in history and determines that the dreams of specific cultures add up to a larger collective story of humanity. Stopping short of attempting to be all-inclusive, this fascinating volume will nonetheless be comprehensive, opening with an introduction exploring the nature and dimensions of myth and proposing a definition as a universal language. Briefly dipping into the ways our understanding of myth has changed from Aristotle and Plato to modern scholars such as Joseph Campbell, the introduction loosely places the concept in its present context and precedes articles on influential mythologists and mythological approaches that appear later in the Companion.<br>The main body of Leeming's work consists of A-Z entries covering all aspects of mythology, including substantial essays on the world's major mythological traditions (Greek, Native American, Indian, Japanese, Sumerian, Egyptian), mythological types and motifs (Descent to the Underworld, the Hero, the Trickster, Creation, the Quest), mythological figures (Odysseus, Zeus, Osiris, Spider Woman, and Inanna) as well as numerous interrelated subjects such as fairly tales and legends. The <em>Companion</em> also locates myth in our lives today, relating it to language patterns, psychology, religion, politics, art, and gender attitudes. Many of the better-known and more significant myths are vividly retold in this volume that will be illustrated with maps, more than 70 black and white images, and eight pages of color highlighting the central role art has often played in the transmission and perpetuation of myth. Following the entries, a rich section of appendices will include family trees of the major pantheons, equivalency charts for the gods of Greece and Rome, Babylon and Sumer, as well as other traditions, an extensive bibliography, and an index.<br></p><p>David Leeming is an emeritus professor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of Connecticut.In the introduction to this work, Leeming, an emeritus professor of English and comparative literature who has written extensively on mythology, defines myths as "religious narratives that transcend the possibilities of common experience and that express any given culture's literal or metaphorical understanding of various aspects of reality." Covering a broad range of belief systems dating from prehistoric times to the twenty-first century, this compendium not only traces the myths of various cultures but also shows how a number of common elements thread through many sacred stories from disparate geographic areas.<p>Ranging in length from a single sentence to multiple pages, the approximately 1,500 entries cover deities and other mythological figures (<i>Artemis, Job,</i> <i>Thor</i>); heroic epics and other stories (<i>Iliad,</i> <i>Volsunga Saga</i>); motifs (<i>Afterlife,</i> <i>Flood</i>); mythologists (<i>Campbell</i>, <i>Joseph</i>; <i>Frazer, Sir James</i>); sacred books (<i>Qur'an,</i> <i>Upanishads</i>); and the mythologies of particular regions, religions, or cultures. Only a small percentage of the entries include references to sources for further information. Access is facilitated by a section that categorizes entries by cultural groups or broad topics, a network of cross-references, and an index. Adding visual appeal are a number of black-and-white illustrations and color plates, most of which reproduce artworks that depict mythological themes. Additional features include a lengthy bibliography, family trees for five major pantheons, and charts identifying Greek-Roman and Sumerian-Babylonian equivalent deities.</p><p>With more than twice as many entries, the two-volume <i>Facts On File Encyclopedia of World Mythology and Legend</i> (2004) identifies many more mythological figures than does Leeming's work. In addition, specialized sources such as <i>The Oxford Dictionary of Classical Myth and Religion </i>(2004) and <i>Dictionary of Celtic Mythology </i>(Oxford, 1998) offer more in-depth coverage of specific mythological cultures. The strength of <i>The Oxford Companion to World Mythology</i> lies in its overview articles on mythologies of particular eras and cultures and in its thematic entries that bring together mythological concepts from a variety of traditions.</p><p>Scholarly but rarely abstruse, this reasonably priced volume is particularly suitable for academic and larger public libraries. <i>Marie Ellis</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This cozy house becomes the object of an inheritance dispute between the upright conservative Wilcox family and the Schlegel sisters, Margaret and Helen, sensitive and intuitive women loved by men willing to leap wide social barriers to fulfill their ardor. Through romantic entanglements, disappearing wills, and sudden tragedy, the conflict over the house emerges as a symbolic struggle for England&#x2019;s future. Rich with the tradition, spirit, and wit distinctively English, <b>Howards End</b> is a remarkable novel of rare insight and understanding. As in his celebrated <i>A Passage to India</i>, E. M. Forster brings to vivid life a country and an era through the destinies of his unforgettable characters.</p><p>Margaret Schlegel, engaged to the much older, widowed Henry Wilcox, meets her intended the morning after accepting his proposal and realizes that he is a man who has lived without introspection or true self-knowledge. As she contemplates the state of Wilcox's soul, her remedy for what ails him has become one of the most oft-quoted passages in literature: <blockquote>Only connect! That was the whole of her sermon. Only connect the prose and the passion and both will be exalted, and human love will be seen at its height. Live in fragments no longer.</blockquote> Like all of Forster's work, <i>Howards End</i> concerns itself with class, nationality, economic status, and how each of these affects personal relationships. It follows the intertwined fortunes of the Schlegel sisters, Margaret and Helen, and the Wilcox family over the course of several years. The Schlegels are intellectuals, devotees of art and literature. The Wilcoxes, on the other hand, can't be bothered with the life of the mind or the heart, leading, instead, outer lives of "telegrams and anger" that foster "such virtues as neatness, decision, and obedience, virtues of the second rank, no doubt, but they have formed our civilization." Helen, after a brief flirtation with one of the Wilcox sons, has developed an antipathy for the family; Margaret, however, forms a brief but intense friendship with Mrs. Wilcox, which is cut short by the older woman's death. When her family discovers a scrap of paper requesting that Henry give their home, Howards End, to Margaret, it precipitates a spiritual crisis among them that will take years to resolve.<p> Forster's 1910 novel begins as a collection of seemingly unrelated events--Helen's impulsive engagement to Paul Wilcox; a chance meeting between the Schlegel sisters and an impoverished clerk named Leonard Bast at a concert; a casual conversation between the sisters and Henry Wilcox in London one night. But as it moves along, these disparate threads gradually knit into a tightly woven fabric of tragic misunderstandings, impulsive actions, and irreparable consequences, and, eventually, connection. Though set in the early years of the 20th century, <i>Howards End</i> seems even more suited to our own fragmented era of e-mails and anger. For readers living in such an age, the exhortation to "only connect" resonates ever more profoundly. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>9 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>National Geographic Little Kids First Big Book of the World</h2><p>This charming reference introduces young readers to the wider world by exploring languages, landscapes, weather, animals, capital cities, mountains, deserts, and other landscapes and landforms, and more.

It seems to be written at a level that is effective for both groups. I chose it because I know Dick and respect his research.

The authors have searched out the stories these buildings have to tell, considered the intentions of the people who built them, and examined the lives of those who used them. The text begins with prehistory and ends with early twenty-first century. It covers the Western tradition as well as works in the Islamic world, the pre-Columbian Americas, Africa, China, Southeast Asia, Russia, and Japan.<br><br><i>Buildings Across Time</i> is a diverse sampling of the built environment written in a straightforward but lively style that is rich with detail. The text contains extensive descriptive narrative leavened with focused critical analysis, which allows the book to stand alone and invites lecturers to impose their studied interpretations on the material without the danger of undue ambiguity or conflict. In a world that grows smaller by the day, it presents a global perspective, and in a discipline that concerns built objects that are often beautiful as well as functional, it is copiously illustrated, intelligently designed, and consistently usable.<br><br>Instructors and students can now access their course content through the Connect digital learning platform by purchasing either standalone Connect access or a bundle of print and Connect access.

It was in this short span of time that Dostoevsky produced three of his greatest novels--<i>Crime and Punishment, The Idiot,</i> and <i>The Devils</i>--and two of his best novellas, <i>The Gambler</i> and <i>The Eternal Husband</i>. All these masterpieces were written in the midst of harrowing practical and economic circumstances, as Dostoevsky moved from place to place, frequently giving way to his passion for roulette. Having remarried and fled from Russia to escape importuning creditors and grasping dependents, he could not return for fear of being thrown into debtor's prison. He and his young bride, who twice made him a father, lived obscurely and penuriously in Switzerland, Germany, and Italy, as he toiled away at his writing, their only source of income. All the while, he worried that his recurrent epileptic attacks were impairing his literary capacities. His enforced exile intensified not only his love for his native land but also his abhorrence of the doctrines of Russian Nihilism--which he saw as an alien European importation infecting the Russian psyche. Two novels of this period were thus an attempt to conjure this looming spectre of moral-social disintegration, while <i>The Idiot</i> offered an image of Dostoevsky's conception of the Russian Christian ideal that he hoped would take its place.</p></p><p>This volume, the fourth of five planned in Joseph Frank's widely acclaimed biography of Dostoevsky, covers the six most remarkably productive years in the novelist's entire career.

Sears ready-to-assemble houses were ordered by mail and shipped by rail wherever a boxcar or two could pull in to unload the meticulously precut lumber and all the materials needed to build an exceptionally sturdy and well-designed house. From Philadelphia, Pa., to Coldwater, Kans., and Cowley, Wyo., Sears put its guarantee on quality bungalows, colonials and Cape Cods, all with the latest modern conveniences--such as indoor plumbing. Houses by Mail tells the story of these precut houses and provides for the first time an incomparable guide to identifying Sears houses across the country. Arranged for easy identification in 15 sections by roof type, the book features nearly 450 house models with more than 800 illustrations, including drawings of the houses and floor plans.

A Violin! </i>by Lloyd Moss and <i>Hot Air: The (Mostly) True Story of the Frist Hot-Air Balloon Ride</i>, which she also wrote. She lives in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania.PreSchool-Grade 3-Inventive illustrations depict the true story of the duck, sheep, and rooster that were "ballooning's first brave passengers" when the Montgolfiers tested their hot-air balloon in 1783. The first three spreads set the stage with lively conversational descriptions of the scene before the balloon takes off. A dramatic shift on the fourth page turn reveals the befuddled animal passengers as they ascend. Most of the remaining text is wordless, with occasional "quacks," "baas," and "cock-a-doodle-doos." With vibrant colors and varied use of panels, full-page illustrations, and spreads, Priceman paces the tale perfectly. An early four-panel scene showing the balloon at various heights while the animals try to figure out what's going on is priceless. So is the spread in which all three become attached to windblown laundry. The voyagers' progress is easy to follow, and events along the way are delightfully rendered. A time line on the endpapers fills in some of the historical data, but this "(mostly) true" version (which the author "heard...from a duck, who heard it from a sheep, who heard it from a rooster a long, long time ago") is just the way it should have happened. Sarah Wilson's <i>Three in a Balloon</i> (Scholastic, 1990; o.p.) covers the same event nicely, but this intriguing historical episode stands up to varied presentations, as Priceman's dynamic visual storytelling ably demonstrates.<i>-Steven Engelfried, Beaverton City Library, OR</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The forms of self-sacrifice often required by the spiritual life--including silence and suppression of desire--are conditions that have been imposed on women for centuries. But, as Carol Lee Flinders makes clear, spirituality and feminism do not have to be diametrically opposed. Drawing on Western and Eastern spiritual traditions, Flinders traces her own developing awareness of the &#34;mutual necessity&#34; of the two disciplines and makes provocative suggestions about the potential of a feminist movement guided by spiritual principles.Bestselling Author and Professor Explores the Paradox After living through the sixties and seventies in a spiritual community of work and service where meditative practices defined, nourished, and sustained her very being, Carol Lee Flinders experienced an awakening. She heard the clamoring bells of feminism and glimpsed its imminent clash with her spiritual practice. <i>At The Root of This Longing: Reconciling a Spiritual Hunger with a Feminist Thirst </i> is the memoir of her journey to understand what seemed to be irreconcilable. What does spirituality look like when it coexists with feminism's sharp critical faculties? And what does feminism do when it is steeped in spiritual perspectives? Author of the critically acclaimed <i>Enduring Grace</i> and co-author of the bestselling cookbook <i>Laurel's Kitchen,</i> Carol Lee Flinders has written a poignant and deeply moving memoir of her internal battle to find her way as a woman and a genuine spiritual seeker. "I feel as though I am looking at two distinct cultures, with two sets of values, for whom the same world could well have two different meanings." In <i> At the Root of This Longing,</i> Flinders identifies and explores four key points at which the path of spirituality and feminism collide: <p>Vowing Silence vs. Finding Voice: How does one reconcile the spiritual practice of being silent and stilling the mind with the feminist practice of finding a voice and making oneself heard in the halls of oppressive institutions? </p><p>Relinquishing Ego vs. Establishing Self: How does one reconcile the spiritual discipline of putting oneself last and unseating the ego with the feminist call to "know who you are" and establish and live up to one's authentic identity? </p><p>Resisting Desire vs. Reclaiming the Body: How does one reconcile the spiritual practice of re-channeling one's desires and dis-identifying with one's senses with the feminist insistence on reclaiming the body and its desires from all those who objectify and demean it? </p><p>Enclosure vs. Freedom: How is one to reconcile the discipline of turning inward and disentangling oneself from external and public activity with the feminist discipline of moving freely and "taking back the streets"? </p><p>Flinders finds inspiration in the enrapturing metaphor of Draupadi--the beautiful, competent, and wise princes-goddess who was known to be extremely devout and proficient in the spiritual disciplines from the great Hindu epic the Mahabharata--who fell into a meditative dance causing her sari to endlessly unfurl as her aggressors attempted to harm her, to forge her conciliatory path. <i>At the Root of This Longing</i> is a fascinating chronicle of the "synchronicities" that Flinders finds on her inner pilgrimage. What she discovers is that, like some of the medieval women mystics such as Julian of Norwich and spiritual teachers such as Ghandi, is that there is a well of strength, courage, and creativity within that can be drawn from through spiritual practice. "We must be capable of speaking from real depths. To be truly and effectively open toward one another, women must find their way into a genuine, active interior life. Through prayer and meditation practiced in disciplined, systematic ways, women can ground themselves in the interior and exterior life-spirit, mind, and body." <i>At the Root of This Longing</i> re-focuses feminism over and against its traditional rejection of spirituality and finds its true strength as a resistance movement based in sacred. Carol Lee Flinders is co-author of the best-selling vegetarian cookbook <i>Laurel's Kitchen</i> and has written about food for newspapers and magazines for over twelve years. In 1993, she published the critically acclaimed <i>Enduring Grace: Living Portraits of Seven Women Mystics</i>. She is an adjunct professor of writing and comparative literature at the University of California at Berkeley.

Young Lenny Sethi is kept out of school because she suffers from polio. She spends her days with Ayah, her beautiful nanny, visiting with the large group of admirers that Ayah draws. It is in the company of these working class characters that Lenny learns about religious differences, religious intolerance, and the blossoming genocidal strife on the eve of Partition. As she matures, Lenny begins to identify the differences between the Hindus, Moslems, and Sikhs engaging in political arguments all around her. Lenny enjoys a happy, privileged life in Lahore, but the kidnapping of her beloved Ayah signals a dramatic change. Soon Lenny&#x2019;s world erupts in religious, ethnic, and racial violence. By turns hilarious and heartbreaking, the domestic drama serves as a microcosm for a profound political upheaval.</p><p>Pakistani Sidhwa's third novel (The Bride, 1983; The Crown Eaters, 1982)--written from the point of view of a young girl who's surrounded by the personal and political violence that accompanied the partitioning of India in 1947--manages to do justice to the complexity of racial, ethnic, and religious violence in the era and to evoke the passage from an affluent childhood to the ambiguities of experience. ``India is going to be broken....And what happens if they break it where our house is?'' asks narrator Lenny, the daughter (who turns eight in 1947) of an affluent Parsi family in Lahore. And in fact her household does break apart when her young nanny, or Ayah, is kidnapped. Before that event takes center stage, the novel glorifies in the ``beautifully endowed'' world, which, as evoked by Sidhwa's luminous present-tense prose, is laminated with the magic of childish wonder: moving between her own house and that of her dynamic Godmother (``It is her nature to know things''), who lives ``with her docile old husband and slavesister,'' Lenny dramatizes the textures of multicultural Indian life, with its summer trips to the Himalayan foothills, dinner parties, visits from the ice-candy man, and, increasingly, hints of ``Hindu-Muslim trouble.'' While Lenny ``learns to tell tales'' by ``offering lengthier and lengthier chatter'' to fill dinner-time silences, she also becomes ``aware of religious differences.'' Sikhs start keeping to themselves, whereas before ``everybody is themselves.'' Violence escalates, India is divided, fires appear ``all over Lahore,'' and Ayah is kidnapped. She's finally found in the red-light district, then rescued through Godmother's influence, but it's clear that- -along with India and Lenny--she will never be the same. Richly layered, both realistic and magically evocative as well as topical: a novel that brings to triumphant life an India that ``has less to do with fate than with the will of men.'' -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>"One man's religion is another man's poison." The child narrator of <b>Cracking India</b> learns this lesson as she experiences the Partition of India in 1947. Comic, violent, turbulent, and full of life, this novel functions vividly on both domestic and historical levels, illuminating the uprooting of seven million Muslims and five million Hindus and Sikhs in "the largest and most terrible exchange of population known to history." In particular, <b>Cracking India</b> explores the effect of Partition on the subcontinent's greatest underclass: women. Events are refracted through the eyes of five year-old Lenny, the indulged daughter of a Parsee family whose tumultuous extended household includes an array of neighbors, servants, and relatives, and Lenny's beloved Ayah. For Lenny, the domestic manifestation of Partition is sudden and menacing: "one day everybody is themselves -- and the next day they are Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christian. People shrink, dwindling into symbols." Witnessing the inexorable cracking apart of her world, with its affection, humor, and balance superseded by bigotry and violence, Lenny comes to a painful understanding of "human needs, frailties, cruelties and joys." In focusing on the domestic drama engendered by a national cataclysm, and by rendering it in the uninformed but clear-sighted voice of a young girl, Bapsi Sidhwa fully evokes the personal costs of an historical event. <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Prudence Hockley</i></p><h2>Eating the Landscape: American Indian Stories of Food, Identity, and Resilience (First Peoples: New Directions in Indigenous Studies)</h2><p><p>"Eating is not only a political act, it is also a cultural act that reaffirms one&#x2019;s identity and worldview," Enrique Salm�n writes in <i>Eating the Landscape</i>. Traversing a range of cultures, including the Tohono O&#x2019;odham of the Sonoran Desert and the Rar�muri of the Sierra Tarahumara, the book is an illuminating journey through the southwest United States and northern Mexico. Salm�n weaves his historical and cultural knowledge as a renowned indigenous ethnobotanist with stories American Indian farmers have shared with him to illustrate how traditional indigenous foodways&#x2014;from the cultivation of crops to the preparation of meals&#x2014;are rooted in a time-honored understanding of environmental stewardship.</p><p>In this fascinating personal narrative, Salm�n focuses on an array of indigenous farmers who uphold traditional agricultural practices in the face of modern changes to food systems such as extensive industrialization and the genetic modification of food crops. Despite the vast cultural and geographic diversity of the region he explores, Salm�n reveals common themes: the importance of participation in a reciprocal relationship with the land, the connection between each group&#x2019;s cultural identity and their ecosystems, and the indispensable correlation of land consciousness and food consciousness. Salm�n shows that these collective philosophies provide the foundation for indigenous resilience as the farmers contend with global climate change and other disruptions to long-established foodways. This resilience, along with the rich stores of traditional ecological knowledge maintained by indigenous agriculturalists, Salm�n explains, may be the key to sustaining food sources for humans in years to come.</p><p>As many of us begin to question the origins and collateral costs of the food we consume, Salm�n&#x2019;s call for a return to more traditional food practices in this wide-ranging and insightful book is especially timely. <i>Eating the Landscape </i>is an essential resource for ethnobotanists, food sovereignty proponents, and advocates of the local food and slow food movements.</p></p><p><p>Enrique Salm�n is head of the American Indian Studies Program at Cal State University East Bay in Hayward, California.

Must reading for every believer. Previous histories have generally left out the Jewish factor. By beginning their research with the later second- and third-century Church, after it became predominantly a Gentile organization, they have lost the history of the first hundred years and the necessary understanding of Jewish roots. Many difficult Hebraic phrases and theological dilemmas can be understood by investigating the original Jewish roots of the early Church. Today, scholars agree, on the most basic level, that Jesus was a Jew who was born, lived, and died, within first-century Judaism. His teaching methods, parables, proverbs, and symbolic style was characteristic of the Judaism of that day. Since both the Old and New Testaments are highly Hebraic, with the background, writers, culture, religion, traditions, and concepts being Hebrew, any analysis should be done from this perspective. This book will propose to show that the earliest Church and its first fifteen elders were Jewish and that the original organizational structure of the early Church came from the synagogical prototype. This investigation will examine major Jewish terms such as Torah, or Law, which, when communicated in the Greek mind-set, have been completely misunderstood. This study will show that the Pharisees of the first century were the orthodox fundamentalists who had within their camp both hypocrites and heroes. Finally, our study will suggest that the early Church was one of the many sects within first-century Judaism, which neither Jesus nor Paul ever tried to leave. Because the early Church remained within Judaism for the first hundred years, the proto-rabbi and the Hebrew culture are essential to understanding its organizational structure.</p><p>[P]revious histories have generally left out the Jewish factor. By beginning their research with the later second- and third-century Church, after it became predominantly a Gentile organization, they have lost the history of the first hundred years and the necessary understanding of Jewish roots. Many difficult Hebraic phrases and theological dilemmas can be understood by investigating the original Jewish roots of the early Church. <p>Today, scholars agree, on the most basic level, that Jesus was a Jew who was born, lived, and died, within first-century Judaism. His teaching methods, parables, proverbs, and symbolic style was characteristic of the Judaism of that day. Since both the Old and New Testaments are highly Hebraic, with the background, writers, culture, religion, traditions, and concepts being Hebrew, any analysis should be done from this perspective. </p><p>This book will propose to show that the earliest Church and its first fifteen elders were Jewish and that the original organizational structure of the early Church came from the synagogical prototype. This investigation will examine major Jewish terms such as Torah, or Law, which, when communicated in the Greek mind-set, have been completely misunderstood. This study will show that the Pharisees of the first century were the orthodox fundamentalists who had within their camp both hypocrites and heroes. Finally, our study will suggest that the early Church was one of the many sects within first-century Judaism, which neither Jesus nor Paul ever tried to leave.

Based on extensive original research, legal scholar Alexandra Natapoff reveals the inner workings of a massive petty offense system that produces over 13 million cases each year. People arrested for minor crimes are swept through courts where defendants often lack lawyers, judges process cases in mere minutes, and nearly everyone pleads guilty. This misdemeanor machine starts punishing people long before they are convicted; it punishes the innocent; and it punishes conduct that never should have been a crime. As a result, vast numbers of Americans -- most of them poor and people of color -- are stigmatized as criminals, impoverished through fines and fees, and stripped of drivers' licenses, jobs, and housing.<br>For too long, misdemeanors have been ignored. But they are crucial to understanding our punitive criminal system and our widening economic and racial divides.<br><b>A <i>Publishers Weekly</i> Best Book of 2018</b><br></p><p><b>Alexandra Natapoff </b>is professor of law at the University of California, Irvine.

From his own singular participation in the day&#x2019;s events and his even more extraordinary perceptions comes a classic work that shatters the mold of traditional reportage.

The strangeness calls for an explanation, and this book provides it by examining the characters and the story in light of the biblical and historical context. <br><br>Bestselling author Scott Hahn who has written extensively on Scripture and the early Church, brings evidence to light, dispelling some of the mystery of the story. Yet Christmas is made familiar all over again by showing it to be a family story. Christmas, as it appears in the New Testament, is the story of a father, a mother, and a child--their relationships, their interactions, their principles, their individual lives, and their common life. To see the life of this "earthly trinity" is to gaze into heaven.</p><p><p><b>Q&amp;A with with Scott Hahn</b></p> <p><strong>Q.In the 20+ years that you&#x2019;ve been writing books, this is the first one that focuses entirely on the Christmas story. What inspired you to write about this topic? Why now?</strong></p> <p>A. Christmas arrives with a powerful effect on small children and on older folks. In between childhood and grandparenthood, we can temporarily lose our capacity for wonder. But maybe the second wave is hitting me now, as I'm experiencing Christmas with my grandchildren as they grow. Going back to the story in recent years, I've discovered complexities, convergences, and moments of stunning beauty that I had not appreciated before. I'm not the first one to notice these things. In fact, I'm learning from the early Fathers and the most recent scholars. But I can't help but want to share them with everyone everyone who's celebrating Christmas.</p> <p><strong>Q. In <i>Joy to the World</i>, you write, "The events of Christmas challenge us, just as they challenged the original characters the family whose history they tell." What do you see as the biggest challenge of Christmas?</strong></p> <p>A. To welcome Jesus. That's always the challenge. We think our lives are full, and we don't really trust him to come in and mess with our plans. Even after all these thousands of years, we hang a "no vacancy" sign at the inn. We've built a culture on the illusion of control, and Christ is a threat to that illusion. Maybe that's why he came as a little baby. In my own experience, however, it's been my babies my children who taught me what little control I really have. If we're open to life, if we're open to Christ, we come to trust God's providential plan. That's a lesson of the Christmas story. Just ask Zechariah. Just ask Joseph.</p><p>Stepping out in trust is scary, and the Christmas story confirms that at every turn. But what's the alternative? To cling to the illusion of control just because it's our familiar illusion? Herod is the Christmas character most like our modern-day control freaks; and his life is completely out of control. Joseph, on the other hand, entrusts himself to the angels and goes from one trial to another. Yet today we can see Joseph's life as heroic and true, and Herod's as just plain crazy.</p> <p><strong>Q. How did you come up with the title <i>Joy to the World</i>?</strong></p> <p>A. I've been thinking a lot about joy ever since Pope Benedict declared the Year of Saint Paul. I remember I was in Jerusalem that summer and reading the Letter to the Philippians, and I was overwhelmed by his exhortation to joy. "Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, Rejoice!" (Philippians 4:4). Go read that letter and count the number of times you see the words "joy" and "rejoice." Well, Paul's words took hold of me and wouldn't let go. Now we have a pope, our beloved Pope Francis, who speaks to us of the "Joy of the Gospel." Joy is a quality that belongs to Christmas. We sing it in our Christmas carols because in Christmas we celebrate the reason for Paul's rejoicing: the advent of the Messiah, the salvation of the whole world. We have good reasons to celebrate. We have good reasons for our joy.</p> <p><strong>Q. What is your favorite part of the Christmas story?</strong></p> <p>A. It depends on the day you ask me. Today I'm caught up in thinking about the angels, and how different they appear after the advent of our savior. In the Old Testament, they are frightening and intimidating to human beings. Think of the Prophet Daniel, who falls on his face in dumbstruck fear. In the Christmas story, however, they appear as guides and companions. Jesus changes everything in the order of the universe. He changes the way heaven relates to earth and the way people relate to angels. I marvel as I consider what else has been changed so profoundly what else have I missed?</p><b>DR. SCOTT W.

Neither was I supposed to hear that my clutching at the doctor&#x2019;s clothes could just as easily have been a cry of, &#x201c;Help! I&#x2019;m falling!&#x201d; rather than, &#x201c;Stand aside!

And ten helmeted women on roller skates were racing round a flat ring delineated with tape on the concrete floor. </p><p>It was supposed to be an exhibition match only: something to educate the populace in the finer points of women&#x2019;s flat track roller derby. But it was a case of tell-that-to-the-players, for the women engaged in the bout were deadly serious. </p><p>They had intriguing names. All of them were printed, along with suitably menacing photos, in the programmes that had been distrib�uted as spectators took their seats. Lynley had chuckled as he&#x2019;d read each nom de guerre. Vigour Mortis. The Grim Rita. Grievous Bodily Charm. </p><p>He was there because of one of the women, Kickarse Electra. She skated not with the local team&#x2014;London&#x2019;s the Electric Magic&#x2014;but rather with the team from Bristol, a savage-looking group of females who went by the alliterative collective Boadicea&#x2019;s Broads. Her actual name was Daidre Trahair, she was a large animal veterinarian em�ployed at Bristol&#x2019;s zoo, and she had no idea that Lynley was among the howling mass of spectators. He wasn&#x2019;t sure if he was going to keep matters that way. He was, at this point, operating strictly by feel. </p><p>He had a companion with him, having lacked the courage to ven�ture into this unknown world on his own. Charlie Denton had ac�cepted his invitation to be enlightened, educated, and entertained at Earls Court Exhibition Centre, and at this moment, he was milling among the crowd at the snack stall. </p><p>He&#x2019;d made the declaration of &#x201c;It&#x2019;s on me, m&#x2019;lord . . . sir,&#x201d; with that final word a hasty correction that one would think by now he&#x2019;d not even have to make. For he&#x2019;d been seven years in Lynley&#x2019;s employ, and when he wasn&#x2019;t addressing his passion for the stage through auditions for various theatrical events in Greater London, he served as manser�vant, cook, housekeeper, aide-de-camp, and general factotum in Lyn�ley&#x2019;s life. He&#x2019;d so far managed Fortinbras in a north London production, but the West End north London was not. So he soldiered on in his double life, determinedly believing that his Big Break was only round the next corner. </p><p>Now, he was amused. Lynley could see that in Denton&#x2019;s face as he made his way back across Brompton Hall to the array of chairs among which Lynley sat. He carried a cardboard food tray with him. </p><p>&#x201c;Nachos,&#x201d; Denton said as Lynley frowned down at something that looked like orange lava erupting from a mountain of fried tortilla. &#x201c;Your dog&#x2019;s got mustard, onions, and relish. The ketchup looked iffy so I gave it a pass, but the lager&#x2019;s nice. Have at it, sir.&#x201d; </p><p>Denton said all this with a twinkle in his eye, although Lynley reckoned it could have been just the light shining on the lenses of his round-framed spectacles. He was daring Lynley to refuse the offered repast and instead come forth as he really was. He was also entertained by the sight of his employer sitting chummily next to a bloke whose potbelly overhung his baggy jeans and whose dreadlocks fell the length of his back. Lynley and Denton had come to depend upon this indi�vidual. His name was Steve-o, and what he didn&#x2019;t know about women&#x2019;s flat track roller derby did not, apparently, bear knowing at all. </p><p>He was attached to Flaming Aggro, he&#x2019;d told them happily. Plus, his sister Soob was a member of the cheering squad. This latter group of individuals had taken up a position whose disturbing proximity to Lynley added to the general cacophony surrounding him. They wore black from head to toe with embellishments of hot pink in the form of tutus, hair decorations, knee socks, shoes, or waistcoats, and they had so far spent most of their time screaming &#x201c;Break &#x2019;em, baby!&#x201d; and shaking pink and silver pompoms. </p><p>&#x201c;Great sport, innit?&#x201d; Steve-o kept saying as the Electric Magic piled the points onto the scoreboard. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s tha&#x2019; Deadly Deedee-light does most of the scoring. Long &#x2019;s she don&#x2019;t rack up the penalties, we&#x2019;re in, mate.&#x201d; And then onto his feet he leapt, shouting, &#x201c;Do it, Aggro!&#x201d; as his girlfriend swept by in the midst of the pack. </p><p>Lynley was loath to tell Steve-o that he was a supporter of Boadi�cea&#x2019;s Broads. It was a matter of chance that he and Denton had placed themselves among the Electric Magic fans. The Boadicea&#x2019;s Broads crowd was on the other side of the taped-off ring, being led into a frenzy of synchronised shouting by their own squad of cheerleaders who, like those supporting the Electric Magic, were dressed in black but with touches of red. They appeared to have more experience in the arena of cheerleading. They executed vague dance moves with accompanying leg kicks that were most impressive. </p><p>It was the sort of event that should have appalled Lynley. Had his father been there&#x2014;doubtless dressed to the nines with one or two touches of ermine and red velvet lest someone doubt his position in society&#x2014;he would have lasted less than five minutes. The sight of the women on roller skates might have given him a coronary, and listen�ing to Steve-o drop his t&#x2019;s and ignore his h&#x2019;s would have made the poor man&#x2019;s blood run cold. But Lynley&#x2019;s father was long in his grave, and Lynley himself had spent most of the evening grinning so much that his cheeks were actually beginning to hurt. </p><p>He&#x2019;d learned far more than he&#x2019;d ever have imagined possible upon having made the decision to accept the invitation that had been printed on a handbill he&#x2019;d found among his post a few days earlier. </p><p>He&#x2019;d discovered they were meant to keep their eyes on the jammer, identified by the star cap that stretched across her helmet. This wasn&#x2019;t a permanent position for a skater, as the star cap was passed round among the women. But the jammer was the team&#x2019;s scoring position, and the ultimate scoring came during a power jam when the oppos�ing team&#x2019;s jammer had to sit in the penalty box. He&#x2019;d learned the purpose of the pack and, thanks to Steve-o, what it meant when the lead jammer rose from her crouched position to place her hands on her hips. He was still rather vague on the purpose of the pivot&#x2014; although he knew who she was by the striped cap she wore stretched over her helmet&#x2014;but he was definitely getting the idea that roller derby was a sport of strategy as well as skill. </p><p>Mostly, he&#x2019;d kept his eyes on Kickarse Electra throughout the match-up between London and Bristol. She, he discovered, was quite a jammer. She skated aggressively, like a woman to the roller skates born. Lynley wouldn&#x2019;t have thought it possible of the quiet, thoughtful veterinarian he&#x2019;d met seven months earlier on the coast of Cornwall. He knew she was practically unbeatable at darts. But this . . . ? He never would have guessed it. </p><p>His pleasure in the wild sport had been interrupted only once, in the middle of a power jam. He&#x2019;d felt his mobile vibrate in his pocket, and he&#x2019;d dug it out to see who was ringing him. His first thought was that the Met was calling him back to work. For the caller was his usual partner, Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers. Still, she was ring�ing from her home phone and not from her mobile so perhaps, he thought, he was in luck and nothing had occurred that wanted his attention. </p><p>He&#x2019;d answered, but he&#x2019;d not been able to hear her. The noise was far too intense. He&#x2019;d shouted that he would ring her back as soon as he was able to do so, and he&#x2019;d shoved the mobile back into his pocket and forgotten about the matter. </p><p>The Electric Magic won the bout twenty minutes later. The two groups of skaters congratulated each other. Athletes mingled with spectators then, cheerleaders mingled with athletes, referees mingled with each other. No one was in a hurry to leave, which was all to the good since Lynley intended to do a little mingling himself. </p><p>He turned to Denton. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sir.&#x201d; </p><p>Denton said, &#x201c;Pardon?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re here as friends. Make it school chums. You can do that, can&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;What, me? Eton?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s well within your skill set, Charlie. And call me either Thomas or Tommy. It doesn&#x2019;t matter which.&#x201d; </p><p>Denton&#x2019;s round eyes got even rounder behind his spectacles. He said, &#x201c;You want me to . . . I&#x2019;ll probably choke if I try to say it.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Charlie, you&#x2019;re an actor, yes?&#x201d; Lynley said. &#x201c;This is your BAFTA moment. I&#x2019;m not your employer, you&#x2019;re not my employee. We&#x2019;re going to talk to someone, and you&#x2019;re going to pose as my friend. It&#x2019;s . . .&#x201d; He sought the correct term. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s improv.&#x201d; </p><p>Charlie&#x2019;s face brightened. &#x201c;C&#x2019;n I do the Voice?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;If you must. Come with me.&#x201d; </p><p>Together, then, they approached Kickarse Electra. She was in conver�sation with London&#x2019;s Leaning Tower of Lisa, an impressive Amazonian who stood at least six feet five inches tall in her roller skates. She would have been an imposing presence anywhere, and she was particularly striking next to Kickarse Electra, who, even in her skates, was some seven inches shorter. </p><p>Leaning Tower of Lisa first saw Lynley and Denton. She said, &#x201c;You two look like trouble of the very best kind. I claim the smaller one.&#x201d; And she rolled over to Denton and put her arm round his shoulders. She kissed his temple. He became the colour of pomegranate seeds. </p><p>Daidre Trahair turned. She&#x2019;d taken off her helmet and she&#x2019;d raised a pair of plastic goggles to the top of her head. They now held back wisps of her sandy hair, which had escaped from the French braid that contained it. She was wearing her spectacles beneath her goggles, but they were badly smudged. She could see through them perfectly well, though, a fact Lynley ascertained by the colour that her skin took on when she looked at him. He could only just see this colour through her makeup, however. Like the other skaters, she was heavily painted, with an emphasis on glitter and lightning bolts. </p><p>&#x201c;My God,&#x201d; she said. </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been called worse.&#x201d; He held up the handbill advertising this event. &#x201c;We thought to take up the offer. Brilliant, by the way. We </p><p>quite enjoyed it.&#x201d; </p><p>Leaning Tower of Lisa said, &#x201c;This your first?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;It is,&#x201d; Lynley told her. And then to Daidre, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re far more skilled than you let on when we first met. You do this as well as you throw darts, I see.&#x201d; </p><p>Daidre&#x2019;s colour deepened. Leaning Tower of Lisa said to her, &#x201c;You know these blokes?&#x201d; </p><p>Daidre said inarticulately, &#x201c;Him. I know him.&#x201d; </p><p>Lynley extended his hand to the other skater. &#x201c;Thomas Lynley,&#x201d; he told her. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got your arm round my friend Charlie Denton.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Charlie, is it?&#x201d; Leaning Tower said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s awfully sweet-looking. Are you sweet in character as well as in looks, Charlie?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I believe he is,&#x201d; Lynley told her. </p><p>&#x201c;Does he like big women, then?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I expect he takes them as they come.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t talk much, does he?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;You might be an overpowering presence.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t that always the case?&#x201d; Leaning Tower released Denton with a laugh and another solid kiss on his temple. &#x201c;You change your mind, you know where to find me,&#x201d; she said to him as she rolled away to join her mates. </p><p>Daidre Trahair had apparently used the duration of this exchange to come to her wits. She said, &#x201c;Thomas. You&#x2019;re the last person I would have thought to see at a roller derby match.&#x201d; Then she turned to Denton and extended her hand, saying, &#x201c;Charlie, I&#x2019;m Daidre Trahair. How&#x2019;d you like the match?&#x201d; She offered this question to them both. </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d no idea women could be so ruthless,&#x201d; Lynley said. </p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s Lady Macbeth,&#x201d; Denton pointed out. </p><p>&#x201c;There is that.&#x201d; </p><p>Lynley&#x2019;s mobile vibrated in his pocket. He took it out and gave it a glance as before. As before, the caller was Barbara Havers. He let it go to message as Daidre said, &#x201c;Work?&#x201d; Before he could reply, she added, &#x201c;You are back at it, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I am,&#x201d; he told her. &#x201c;But not tonight. Tonight Charlie and I would like you to join us for a postgame . . . whatever. If you&#x2019;ve a mind for it.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; She looked from him to the milling skaters. She said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s only that . . . the team usually go out. It&#x2019;s rather a tradition. Would you like to join us? Apparently this group&#x201d;&#x2014;with a nod at the Electric Magic&#x2014;&#x201c;go to Famous Three Kings on North End Road. Everyone&#x2019;s invited. It&#x2019;ll be a bit of a crowd scene.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; Lynley said. &#x201c;I was rather hoping&#x2014;we were hoping&#x2014;for something more conducive to conversation. Can you possibly break with this tradition for once?&#x201d; </p><p>She said regretfully, &#x201c;I do wish . . . It&#x2019;s only that we&#x2019;ve come by coach, you see. It would be rather difficult. I have to return to Bristol.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Tonight?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Well, no. We&#x2019;re in a hotel for the night.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;We can take you there whenever you&#x2019;re ready,&#x201d; he offered. And when she still hesitated, he added, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re actually quite harmless, Charlie and I.&#x201d; </p><p>Daidre looked from him to Denton and back to him. She fingered back some of the hair that had come undone from the braid. She said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid I have nothing special . . . I mean, we don&#x2019;t generally dress for going out.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;We shall find a place entirely suitable for whatever state of dis�habille you demonstrate,&#x201d; Lynley told her. &#x201c;Do say yes, Daidre,&#x201d; he added in a quiet voice. </p><p>Perhaps it was the use of her name. Perhaps it was the change in his tone. She thought for a moment and then said all right. But she would have to change and perhaps she ought to get rid of the glitter and the lightning bolts as well? </p><p>&#x201c;I find them rather compelling,&#x201d; Lynley told her. &#x201c;What about you, Charlie?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;It all makes a certain statement,&#x201d; Denton said. </p><p>Daidre laughed. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell me what that statement is. I&#x2019;ll be a few minutes. Where shall I meet you?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be just outside. I&#x2019;ll pull my car round the front.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;How will I know...?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Oh, you&#x2019;ll know,&#x201d; Denton told her. </p><p><br></p><p><b>CHELSEA</b><br><b>LONDON </b></p><p><br></p><p>&#x201c;I see what he meant&#x201d; were Daidre&#x2019;s first words to Lynley when he got out of the car at her approach. &#x201c;What is this exactly? How old is it?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Healey Elliott,&#x201d; he told her. He opened the door for her. &#x201c;Nine�teen forty-eight.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Love of his life,&#x201d; Denton added from the back as she slid within. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m hoping he leaves it to me in his will.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Small chance of that,&#x201d; Lynley told him. &#x201c;I plan to outlive you by several decades.&#x201d; He pulled away from the building and headed towards the car park&#x2019;s exit. </p><p>&#x201c;How do you two know each other?&#x201d; Daidre asked. </p><p>Lynley didn&#x2019;t reply till they were on Brompton Road, motoring past the cemetery. &#x201c;School together&#x201d; was what he said. </p><p>&#x201c;With my older brother,&#x201d; Denton added. </p><p>Daidre glanced over he...</p></p><h2>Stormy</h2><p>Allan Marley and his father have lived together&nbsp;&nbsp;in the untamed wilderness of the Beaver Flowage all&nbsp;&nbsp;their lives.

The geographical division between the Eastern and Western Churches was only one manifestation of deeper rifts, characterized by a long history of conflicts, suspicions, and misunderstandings. Although the art, monasticism, and spirituality of Byzantium have come to be recognized as inspirational and influential in the shaping of Eastern European civilization, and of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance as well, the West has been in the main ignorant of the historical evolution and the doctrinal significance of Byzantine theology.</p><p>Here, for the first time in English, is presented a synthesis of Byzantine Christian thought. The reader is guided through its complexities to an understanding of Byzantium: its view of man and his destiny of "deification"; its ability to transcend the "Western captivity"; its survival under quite adverse historical circumstances. In the end, he may well find himself receptive to the basic positions of Byzantine thought, which have attained, in this time of need for the reintegration of Christianity itself, a surprising, contemporary relevance.</p></p><p>The aim of this book is to describe the categories of theological thought as they were shaped in the framework of Byzantine Christian civilization, its philosophy of life, its liturgy, and its art, and as they persist in contemporary Eastern Orthodoxy. The central theme, or intuition, of Byzantine theology is that man&#39;s nature is not a static, &#39;closed, &#39; autonomous entity, but a dynamic reality, determined in its very existence by its relationship to God.John Meyendorff, Professor of Byzantine and Eastern European History at Fordham University, is an Orthodox priest, a holder of the D. es L. (Sorbonne), and the author of several books on Orthodoxy.</p><h2>Socialism Betrayed: Behind the Collapse of the Soviet Union</h2><p>"A fresh multi-faceted look at the overthrow of the Soviet State, the dismemberment of the Soviet Union, and the campaign to introduce capitalism from above. Roger Keeran and Thomas Kenny have given us a clear and powerful Marxist analysis of the momentous events which most directly shaped world politics today, the destruction of the USSR, the 'Superpower' of socialism." <br> -Norman Markowitz, author of <i>The Rise and Fall of the People's Century</i><p> "I have not read anything else with such detailed and intimate knowledge of what took place. This manuscript is the most important contribution I have read." <br> -Phillip Bonosky, author of <i>Afghanistan-Washington's Secret War</i></p><p> "A well-researched work containing a great deal of useful historical information. Everyone will benefit greatly from the mass of historical data and the thought-provoking arguments contained in the book." <br> -Bahman Azad, author of <i>Heroic Struggle Bitter Defeat: Factors Contributing to the Dismantling of the Socialist State in the USSR</i></p></p><p></p><h2>Liberalism Is A Sin</h2><p>Liberalism is THE error of our times. It is essentially the mistaken notion that one religion is as good as another and that people have a right freely to choose whatever religion suits them best. The author calls Liberalism &#34;the monster of our times,&#34; &#34;the evil of all evils,&#34; &#34;a deadly heresy,&#34; &#34;a living lion going about seeking whom he may devour.&#34; Further, he states: &#34;Liberalism and Catholic Liberalism have been explicitly condemned by Pius IX.&#34; Again, &#34;Liberalism of every degree and all forms has been formally condemned; so much so that outside the motives of its intrinsic malice, it stands under the formal ban of the Church, which is sufficient for all faithful Catholics. It would be impossible for an error so widespread and so radical to escape condemnation.&#34; &#34;Liberalism Is a Sin&#34; is a translation and an adapted version of &#34;El Liberalismo es Pecado,&#34; written and published in 1886 in Spain. Yet it reads as if it were written today! Unfortunately, its comments are even more germane today than when it first appeared. In this book, all shades of the deadly error of Liberalism are exposed and the antidote for combatting Liberalism is carefully outlined. Like a cleaver, this book chops through the mushy, non-logical thinking of Liberalism - which infects most people today, including, sadly, the majority of Catholics. With Liberalism almost universally triumphant in our times, it can be categorically stated that no Catholic book in print today is more potent that &#34;Liberalism Is a Sin,&#34; and none is more deserving our studied attention.</p><p>Dr. Don Felix Sarda y Salvany was a priest and author, born in 1844 near Barcelona. Over the course of forty years, he discussed all the current issues of his time with the understanding of the Catholic faith, as director of the <i>Revista</i> periodical. His potent work entitled <i>Liberalism Is a Sin</i> succeeds in exposing, in very clear terms, the intrinsic evil of liberalism and Catholic liberalism, and was first published in 1899 by the B. Herder Book Company. The work was also retypeset by TAN in 1993. Father Salvany died in 1916.<br></p><h2>Dying for Devil&#39;s Food (Cupcake Bakery Mystery)</h2><p><b>As the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling series continues, it's going to take every recipe the Fairy Tale Cupcake crew has to whip up a quick defense for Mel Cooper when her high school reunion goes from a cake walk to a car wreck...</b><br><br>Melanie Cooper has zero interest in catering her fifteen-year high school reunion, but Angie insists it's only right that they bask in the success of Fairy Tale Cupcakes--and Mel's engagement to the delicious Joe DeLaura is the cherry on top!<br><br>Everything is going better than expected until Cassidy Havers, resident mean girl and Mel's high school nemesis, picks a fight.

She blew her blond bangs off her forehead as she glared at her business partner, who had just come running through the swinging doors from the front of the bakery into the kitchen, where Mel was working.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s Angie Harper to you, and&#x201d;&#x2014;she paused to strike a pose and fan herself with a large envelope and fancy-looking invitation before she continued&#x2014;&#x201c;to everyone else we graduated high school with fifteen years ago.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Huh?&#x201d; Mel frowned at her recently married petite brunette friend.</p><p>&#x201c;Our fifteen-year reunion,&#x201d; Angie said. She pointed to the envelope in her hand. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s coming up and guess who they want to bake cupcakes for it?&#x201d;</p><p>Mel stared at her childhood friend who was the sister of her heart. How could she put this as tactfully and delicately as possible?</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; Mel used a rubber spatula to scrape the glob off the ruined cupcake and flicked it into the large garbage bin to her right.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Angie froze in mid-fan. &#x201c;What do you mean, no?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have no intention of baking cupcakes for those people,&#x201d; Mel said.</p><p>She bent over the cake in front of her. It was a red velvet cupcake with cream-cheese frosting. She was keeping it simple and working the frosting in a thick smooth swirl that she then sprinkled with small red hearts. Just the thought of going to her high school reunion made her want to mainline the frosting and shove a whole cupcake into her mouth like a boss.</p><p>&#x201c;But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but,&#x201d; Angie stammered. It was clear she hadn&#x2019;t anticipated this sort of response, which boggled Mel, but she continued on.</p><p>&#x201c;No buts,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome to go to our reunion but I refuse.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mel, I don&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;re grasping the big picture here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m grasping it and I&#x2019;m tossing it away.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But look at us,&#x201d; Angie said. She swung her arms wide to encompass the kitchen and beyond. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re hugely successful. We have franchises all over the country. That gives us a moral imperative to show up at our reunion.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mel, I know there were some people who hurt your feelings back in the day&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hurt my feelings?&#x201d; Mel straightened up. She grabbed a pinch of heart-shaped sprinkles and didn&#x2019;t so much sprinkle them as threw them onto the freshly piped frosting. She stared at her friend. &#x201c;Angie, they called me &#x2018;Melephant,&#x2019; they bullied me about my weight, and Cassidy Havers, in particular, wrote my name in all of the boys&#x2019; bathrooms with my phone number. She was vicious and mean and cruel and if I never see her again, it will be too soon.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s Cassidy Havers-Griffin now,&#x201d; Angie said.</p><p>&#x201c;Griffin?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, as in Daniel Griffin.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She married Danny?&#x201d; Mel asked. She felt her old high school crush spread its wings and rise out of the ashes of her adolescent heart like a phoenix. &#x201c;When?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A couple of years ago,&#x201d; Angie said. &#x201c;I think you were in Paris at culinary school at the time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you didn&#x2019;t mention it?&#x201d;</p><p>Angie just looked at her and Mel nodded. Yeah, she wouldn&#x2019;t have told Angie if her high school crush had gotten married, either. Oh, wait, her crush had been Tate Harper and he had gotten married six months ago. To Angie.</p><p>&#x201c;But you&#x2019;re going to marry Joe,&#x201d; Angie said. &#x201c;And you had a much deeper and longer-lasting crush on Joe than on Danny, right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, of course, but I can&#x2019;t believe he married her,&#x201d; Mel said. She shuddered. &#x201c;I mean, he was captain of the basketball team and totally out of my league in high school, and she was the homecoming queen, so I guess it makes sense, but I always hoped he&#x2019;d meet someone&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Mel&#x2019;s voice trailed off. She was not going to say it out loud.</p><p>&#x201c;More like you?&#x201d; Angie guessed.</p><p>This was the problem with besties, they knew you too well.</p><p>&#x201c;No, not like me,&#x201d; Mel said. She felt the need to protest even though they both knew she was full of it. &#x201c;But someone more like me than her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Uh-huh,&#x201d; Angie said. She lowered her head and glanced at Mel through her eyelashes. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe you&#x2019;re going to let Cassidy Havers keep you from our reunion.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t even try it,&#x201d; Mel said. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t manipulate me into going. You&#x2019;re not that good.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But what about the commission?&#x201d; Angie asked. &#x201c;Five hundred cupcakes with little fifteens on them and we can do them in the school colors of gold and black. They will look so cool and we can use them on our website for advertising and get even more reunion jobs.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nope,&#x201d; Mel said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not interested.&#x201d;</p><p>She frosted several more cupcakes and added the sprinkles. Angie didn&#x2019;t move. She just stood there, glaring. Mel knew she was formulating her argument to get Mel on her side. It was never going to happen. Not only because Angie didn&#x2019;t have her older brother Joe DeLaura&#x2019;s lawyerly gifts but also because Mel would not be budged on this. She had less than no interest in seeing anyone from her graduating class. Ever.</p><p>&#x201c;So, the idea of strutting into our reunion, looking amazing, as a successful business owner and renowned pastry chef doesn&#x2019;t appeal to you in the least?&#x201d; Angie asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Not even a little,&#x201d; Mel said. &#x201c;I could not care less what those people think.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And the thought of sashaying into the room on prominent assistant county attorney Joe DeLaura&#x2019;s arm, while flashing that dazzling sparkler of a ring he gave you, does nothing for you, either?&#x201d; Angie asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Not a thing,&#x201d; Mel said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m thrilled to be engaged to Joe but he&#x2019;s not a trophy husband.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You sure about that?&#x201d; Angie asked. &#x201c;Because I&#x2019;m pretty sure every woman in our high school, including a few of the teachers, had a thing for Joe.&#x201d;</p><p>It was true, Mel had to concede that, but she wasn&#x2019;t about to say it out loud or Angie would have her at the reunion so fast her cupcakes would have whiplash.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure Joe would be flattered to hear that,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>She hefted one large tray of cupcakes onto her shoulder and carried it to the walk-in cooler for delivery tomorrow morning. When she came back out, she noted that Angie had her chin set in a defiant tilt. Oh, boy, she wasn&#x2019;t going to let it go. Mel lifted the second tray and carried that one into the cooler as well.</p><p>There was no avoiding Angie as Mel began to clean the steel worktable. Cupcakes were a gloriously messy business. She glanced down at her apron to find some dollops of frosting stuck on the front. She smiled.</p><p>Despite what she&#x2019;d said to Angie, she was thrilled with how successful their enterprise Fairy Tale Cupcakes had become and would have loved to brag about it. When she had started the business with her two childhood best friends, Angie DeLaura&#x2014;now Harper&#x2014;and Tate Harper, a few years ago, she had never envisioned the level of success they had achieved. She knew a lot of it was because of Tate&#x2019;s brilliant business acumen, but she didn&#x2019;t think he could have made them a success if the product she toiled over, the cupcakes, wasn&#x2019;t top notch.</p><p>&#x201c;You realize you&#x2019;re forcing me to go there,&#x201d; Angie said.</p><p>&#x201c;Go where?&#x201d;</p><p>Angie blew out a breath. &#x201c;Mel, don&#x2019;t you want to show off you?&#x201d;</p><p>Mel tipped her head to the side. She felt like a dog hearing a high pitched whistle. &#x201c;Come again?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You. Look at you,&#x201d; Angie demanded.</p><p>Mel glanced down. She noted the hot pink apron, the frosting blobs. Oh, there was a sprinkle stuck in a glob. She flicked it off into the garbage. Beneath the apron, she was the same old Mel in denim capris, slip-on Vans in the chevron pattern, and a plain blue T-shirt. Sexy, she was not. Comfortable, she most definitely was.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not seeing where you&#x2019;re going with this,&#x201d; she said. She gestured to her ensemble. &#x201c;This is not exactly show-off worthy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, it is. Mel, this is your chance to show them what you look like now,&#x201d; Angie said. Her voice was soft as if she was trying to say it in a way that wouldn&#x2019;t offend Mel. Sadly, there was no way to say it without offense.</p><p>&#x201c;You mean I should go to the reunion because I&#x2019;m thinner than I was back then,&#x201d; Mel said. Her voice was tight. &#x201c;I should hold my head high, wearing my size six, sometimes eight, and trot around the room, letting everyone have a good look at the new and improved Melanie Cooper? Is that where you&#x2019;re going with this?&#x201d;</p><p>Angie shrugged. &#x201c;Maybe.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Aw, come on, don&#x2019;t be bashful. You opened this can of worms,&#x201d; Mel said. &#x201c;What do you think will happen if I do that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have the last laugh,&#x201d; Angie cried. There was a fierce light in her brown eyes. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll arrive a hugely successful pastry chef, about to marry a gorgeous district attorney, and you will positively stun them with how beautiful you are.&#x201d;</p><p>They stood staring at each other. Mel gave her friend a small smile. &#x201c;I love that you see it playing out that way. You really are such an idealistic optimist. Here&#x2019;s the problem. That&#x2019;s never going to happen.&#x201d;</p><p>The kitchen doors banged open and Marty Zelaznik, the bakery&#x2019;s octogenarian counter help, stood there with his scrawny arms on his hips and his bald head glowing like a beacon.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Ange, how about a little help out there? The lunch rush came and you vamoosed. I&#x2019;ve got people lined up to the door,&#x201d; he said. He looked at Mel. &#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t kill you to come out and help, either.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; Mel said. She walked around the table to follow him back into the bakery.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, no, you don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Angie said. She was hot on Mel&#x2019;s heels. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not done here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, we are.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Walk and talk, people,&#x201d; Marty barked. &#x201c;We have customers waiting.&#x201d;</p><p>They pushed through the swinging doors and sure enough, there was a line now going out the door. Most were calmly waiting but a few of them looked irritated. Never a good thing.</p><p>&#x201c;Hi, how can I help you?&#x201d; Mel asked the first person in line.</p><p>&#x201c;I need a dozen cupcakes,&#x201d; the woman said. She was twenty-something, dressed in a pale green suit that brought out the red in her blond hair. &#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t know what kind to get. I&#x2019;m meeting my boyfriend&#x2019;s parents for the first time and I&#x2019;m terrified. Cupcakes will help, right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Absolutely,&#x201d; Mel said. &#x201c;If his parents don&#x2019;t appreciate a dozen cupcakes from us, then you&#x2019;re far too good for them.&#x201d;</p><p>The girl laughed and Mel guided her in picking out a solid dozen with a dairy-and-gluten-free option thrown in just in case there were some dietary intolerance issues. Then it was on to the next customer and the next. The business did not stop Angie from badgering her about the reunion, however.</p><p>&#x201c;We could rent a limo,&#x201d; Angie said while boxing up an order.</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>Mel tried to avoid the discussion but Angie was persistent.</p><p>&#x201c;How about we get Mean Christine to do our hair and makeup?&#x201d; Angie asked while Mel rang up a customer. &#x201c;She always makes us look amazing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;ve been to Christine&#x2019;s,&#x201d; the customer said. &#x201c;She can roll back the years like nobody&#x2019;s business.&#x201d;</p><p>Mel shoved the box of cupcakes at the woman, who lifted her eyebrows, took the box, and left.</p><p>&#x201c;Angie, I am not going,&#x201d; Mel said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how many ways I can say this to make you understand.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re just being difficult,&#x201d; Angie said. She crossed her arms over her chest with such a look of immovability she could have sprouted roots.</p><p>&#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m not,&#x201d; Mel protested. &#x201c;You can go with Tate. You don&#x2019;t need me there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I do,&#x201d; Angie cried. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re my best friend. Besides, our whole business is successful because of you. We need to be there together to represent.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2018;You know, even though I had to wear that stupid back brace and you were kind of fat, we were still totally cutting edge,&#x2019;&#x201d; Mel said.</p><p>&#x201c;Romy and Michele&#x2019;s High School Reunion,&#x201d; Angie identified the movie quote. It was a longtime game between them as movie lovers to stump each other with movie quotes. &#x201c;I have been waiting for you to bust that out since I mentioned the reunion.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What reunion?&#x201d; Olivia Puckett, Marty&#x2019;s squeeze, asked as she entered the bakery, which had finally cleared out.</p><p>&#x201c;Our fifteen-year high school reunion,&#x201d; Mel said.</p><p>&#x201c;Fifteen?&#x201d; Olivia looked them up and down. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d have thought you were on twenty by now.&#x201d;</p><p>Angie emitted a low growl from her throat. Mel instinctively stepped in front of her to block her from Olivia.</p><p>&#x201c;Why are you here?&#x201d; Mel asked Olivia with narrowed eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m taking my honey out for a late lunch,&#x201d; Olivia said. She blew a kiss at Marty and he leapt into the air, pretending to catch it. Mel hope he didn&#x2019;t slip a hip with that maneuver.</p><p>&#x201c;Gagging,&#x201d; Angie said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m actually gagging.&#x201d;</p><p>Olivia gave her a dark look. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter, short stack? Is the bloom off your newly wedded rose?&#x201d;</p><p>This time Mel wrapped an arm around Angie&#x2019;s head and pulled her in close. She supposed it could technically be called a headlock, but it prevented Angie&#x2019;s wildly swinging fist from connecting with Olivia&#x2019;s nose, so Mel figured it was for the greater good.</p><p>&#x201c;Now, Liv, be nice,&#x201d; Marty said. &#x201c;Mel is having issues because she&#x2019;s too chicken&#x2014;bock bock&#x2014;to face her old classmates at her reunion.&#x201d;</p><p>Mel dropped her arm and Angie careened forward. Olivia side-stepped behind a table just in time.</p><p>&#x201c;I am not chicken!&#x201d; Mel protested.</p><p>That brought Angie up short and she whirled around to look at Mel as if she could not be serious. &#x201c;Yes, you are! Otherwise, why don&#x2019;t you want to go? Brittany Nilsson is coordinating the whole thing and she says just about everyone has RSVP&#x2019;d yes. She was so excited about your cupcakes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Like I care what Brittany Nilsson thinks of my cupcakes,&#x201d; Mel scoffed. &#x201c;I have no reason to go. I don&#x2019;t care about high school or any of those lame people. I kept in touch with the people who were my friends and that&#x2019;s all that matters.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s me and Tate,&#x201d; Angie said. She held up two fingers.</p><p>&#x201c;Exactly,&#x201d; Mel said. &#x201c;Why do I need anyone else?&#x201d;</p><p>Olivia glanced back and forth between them like she was watching a ping-pong match.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re talking about turning down a job for five hundred cupcakes!&#x201d; Angie raised her hands in the air as if she had hit her exasperation breaking point. &#x201c;Most of these people we graduated with are local or still have family here. The potential for more business from this reunion is huge.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care,&#x201d; Mel said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to do it. I don&#x2019;t want to go. I don&#x2019;t want to see any of those people ever again.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re just being stubborn,&#x201d; Angie said.</p><p>&#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m not.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, you are.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m going to lunch,&#x201d; Marty said. &#x201c;Liv, you ready?&#x201d;</p><p>Mel glanced at Olivia, who was suddenly quiet. She had her back to them and was whispering into her phone. Mel stepped closer so she could hear.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;m the owner of Confections bakery. I hear you need five hundred cupcakes,&#x201d; Olivia whispered.</p><p>Angie&#x2019;s eyes went wide. She waved her arms like she was indicating that the bridge was out. &#x201c;Now see what you&#x2019;ve done, Olivia is going to scoop our job.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not on my watch,&#x201d; Mel said.

It offers a behind-the-scenes examination of music from a Cuban point of view, unearthing surprising, provocative connections and making&nbsp;the case&nbsp;that Cuba was fundamental to the evolution of music in the New World. The ways in which&nbsp;the music of black slaves transformed 16th-century Europe, how the <i>claves</i> appeared, and how Cuban music influenced ragtime, jazz, and rhythm and blues are revealed. Music lovers will follow this journey from Andaluc�a, the Congo, the Calabar, Dahomey, and Yorubaland via Cuba to Mexico, Puerto Rico, Saint-Domingue, New Orleans, New York, and Miami. The music is placed in a historical context that considers the complexities of the slave trade; Cuba's relationship to the United States; its revolutionary political traditions; the music of Santer�a, Palo, Abaku�, and Vod�;&nbsp;and much more.<br></p><p><b>Ned Sublette</b> is the cofounder of the Qbadisc record label. He has coproduced the public radio program <i>Afropop Worldwide</i> for seven years and travels frequently to Cuba.As the cofounder of the important Cuban music label Qbadisc and coproducer of public radio's <i>Afropop Worldwide</i>, Sublette is a well-known figure among elite mambo aficionados. Still, the sheer size and historical precision that makes this volume essential is a bit surprising coming from this proud nonacademic. The first two chapters, for instance, offer a fascinating narrative that explains the complex formulation of Iberian culture, beginning with the appearance of Phoenician traders in what is now the southern Spanish city of C�diz in 1104 B.C. When the Cuban story finally kicks in with chapter five, Sublette makes the most of his prehistory to create a visceral and astute vision of the island as incubator of musical revolution. Most of the story has been told before, but rarely in such painstaking detail, and Sublette's easygoing and engaging writing style makes the reading almost painless, although sometimes his analysis is overly determined by politics. His most important accomplishment is combining information from rarely translated musicological works from Cuba with data from his active involvement with surviving giants of the music to produce one sustained, living history. Given all this, it is odd that he ends the book so abruptly, in 1952, especially since he has participated so much in the music's recent permutations. While not exactly for beginners, this book is a solid, supremely lush effort. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In 1979, anger brewed over a show at New York&#x2019;s Artists Space entitled <i>The Nigger Drawings</i>. In 1969, the Metropolitan Museum of Art&#x2019;s exhibition <i>Harlem on My Mind</i> did not include a single work by a black artist.

Merwin is the most influential American poet of the last half-century an artist who has transfigured and reinvigorated the vision of poetry for our time. <i>Migration: New and Selected Poems </i>is that case. This 540-page distillation selected by Merwin from fifteen diverse volumes is a gathering of the best poems from a profound body of work, accented by a selection of distinctive new poems.</p><p>As an undergraduate at Princeton University, Merwin was advised by John Berryman to get down on your knees and pray to the muse every day.&#x201d; <i>Migration</i> represents the bounty of those prayers. Over the last fifty years, Merwin&#x2019;s muse has led him beyond the formal verse of his early years to revolutionary open forms that engage a vast array of influences and possibilities. As Adrienne Rich wrote of Merwin&#x2019;s work: I would be shamelessly jealous of this poetry, if I didn&#x2019;t take so much from it into my own life.&#x201d;</p><p> <b>W. S.

Merwin is one of America&#39;s leading poets. His prizes include the 2005 National Book Award for his collected poems, Migration, the Pulitzer Prize, the Stevens Award, and fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and Lannan Foundation. He is the author of dozens of books of poetry and translations. He lives in Hawaii, where he cultivates endangered palm trees.Mystical formalist, elegant romantic, Vietnam-era protester, translator, maker of sweet memoirs and uneasy dreamscapes, and ecological activist, Merwin has been so prominent for so long that it's hard to believe this rich selection represents the work of just one man. The earliest Merwin&#x2014;a melancholy 1950s craftsman&#x2014;gets the first 70 pages, including the bejeweled verse fairy tale "East of the Sun and West of the Sun." The haunting free verse of the next two decades includes the sad, urgent protest poems of <i>The Lice</i> (1967) and the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning <i>The Carrier of Ladders</i> (1970). Merwin's attraction to instinct and mystery drew his poems toward totemic, resonant images, in lines which imitated chants and prayers. <i>The Rain in the Trees </i>(1988) concerned the forests and coasts of Hawaii, where the poet still lives. His longer, more recent works offer personal memories; "Testimony" (from 1999's <i>The River Sound</i>) takes 56 pages to run through the poet's whole life. Even there&#x2014;and in the few, lyrical, controlled new poems at the very end of the volume&#x2014;Merwin retains a sense of terse whispering, and a graceful attraction to silence; his verse comes, if anyone's does, from "the eye of the mind where we know/ from the beginning that the darkness/ is beyond us." <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In <i>The Unfolding Now</i>, A. H. Almaas presents a marvelously effective practice for developing the transformative quality of presence. Through a particular method of self-observation and contemplative exploration that he calls inquiry, we learn to live in the relaxed condition&nbsp; of simply "being ourselves," without interference from feelings of inadequacy, drivenness toward goals, struggling to figure things out, and rejecting experiences we don't want. Almaas explores the many obstacles&nbsp; that keep us from being present&#x2014;including defensiveness, ignorance, desire, aggression, and self-hatred&#x2014;and shows us how to welcome with curiosity and compassion whatever we are experiencing.</p><p>A. H. Almaas is the pen name of Hameed Ali, the Kuwaiti-born originator of the Diamond Approach, who has been guiding individuals and groups in Colorado, California, and Europe since 1976. He is the author of <i>Spacecrusier Inquiry</i>, <i>The Pearl Beyond Price</i>, <i>Facets of Unity</i>, and other books.&nbsp;<i> </i>"Almaas is a genius at revealing both the core qualities of Essence and the veils that obscure it, always in language that helps peel away those veils, always holding open the door to the unfolding presence and awareness that remains when the veils have dissolved. <i>The Unfolding Now</i> leads the reader through a masterful series of inquiry processes, invitations to sense and know ourselves at increasing levels of subtlety, gently walking us deeper and deeper into Truth."&#x2014;Sally Kempton (Durgananda), spiritual teacher and author of <i>The Heart of Meditation: Pathways to a Deeper Experience</i><br>"I love the unfolding Almaas! His clarity never diminishes, yet each book brings an increasing simplicity and gentleness. As I worked with this latest material, I felt like I was receiving a transmission of pure compassion.

They got themselves ready for school; I, on the other hand, was on vacation. They donned every morning, after bathing and before having breakfast, the same thing: a uniform. <br> &nbsp;<br> My cousins attended different schools and therefore their respective uniforms were also different. My male cousin wore navy blue cotton pants. My female cousin, a few years older, wore a sky-blue skirt. Apart from these two colors, and the yellow tie my male cousin had to knot around his collar, the rest of the uniform was identical: a white short-sleeved shirt, white socks, black shoes.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the closet there were surely two pairs of navy pants, two sky-blue skirts. It was enough to put on what was cleaned and pressed. In America, before leaving for India, my mother would buy several pairs of white socks, knowing that my aunt would be grateful for them.<br> &nbsp;<br> However simple and functional, I found my cousins&#x2019; uniforms splendid, fascinating. On the street, on buses and trams, I was struck by this visual language, thanks to which one could identify and classify thousands of students in such a large and populous city. Every uniform represented belonging to one school or another. Each of my peers in Calcutta enjoyed, to my eyes, a strong identity and, at the same time, a sort of anonymity. This is the effect of the uniform.<br> &nbsp;<br> I would have liked a uniform myself. Whenever I would go to the seamstress to be fitted for new clothes&#x2014;a particular adventure I could experience only in India, where, in the 1970s, it was still common to wear handmade garments instead of buying one&#x2019;s clothing in stores&#x2014;I was tempted to ask for one. It was a foolish desire on my part. Apparel of this kind would have been of no use for me. In America I attended public school, where everyone wore what they wanted. And I was&nbsp;tormented by this choice, by this freedom. <br> &nbsp;<br> When I was a child, expressing myself through clothing was a source of anguish. I already felt different, conspicuous because of my name, my family, my appearance. In all other respects, I wanted to be just like everybody else. I dreamt of sameness, even invisibility. Instead, forced to find my own style, I felt badly dressed, the exception rather than the rule.<br> &nbsp;<br> It didn&#x2019;t help that some of my classmates, finding my clothes somewhat strange, used to tease me. They would say: <i>What an ugly outfit. Those two things clash, didn&#x2019;t you know? No one wears bell-bottoms anymore, they&#x2019;re out of style. </i>They laughed. That is why, for many years, while I waited for the school bus, my day began in a state of humiliation.<br> &nbsp;<br> My classmates derided me and, implicitly, also my parents. Being foreigners, they bought my clothes with an eye toward savings and not toward fashion or norms. They bought my clothes at end-of-season sales or at used clothing stores, knowing that I would outgrow the items in less than a year. My mother, moreover, did not share the taste of American moms. She did not shop in the same stores or dress me like the other girls. This is why I thought that a uniform would&nbsp;have been the solution. <br> &nbsp;<br> Clothing has always carried additional layers of meaning for me. My mother, even today, fifty years after leaving India, wears only the traditional clothing of her country. She barely tolerated my American clothes. She did not find my jeans or T-shirts cute. When I became an adolescent, she disapproved of short skirts, high heels. The older I grew, the more it mattered to her that I, too, wear Indian or, at the very least, concealing clothing. She held out for my becoming a<br> Bengali woman like her.</p><h2>The Children Of Fatima (Saints Lives)</h2><p>\&#34;What if nothing happens on the 13th?

While it is a textbook and not an anthology, <em>Introduction to Women's and Gender Studies</em> adopts the best facets of the anthology approach: it includes discussions of frequently anthologized writers and writing that is more engaging and narrative in style than traditional textbooks.

Indeed, since its original publication in 1977, this hugely popular book has become the definitive source on film and media.<br><br>Now, James Monaco offers a special anniversary edition of his classic work, featuring a new preface and several new sections, including an "Essential Library: One Hundred Books About Film and Media You Should Read" and "One Hundred Films You Should See." As in previous editions, Monaco once again looks at film from many vantage points, as both art and craft, sensibility and science, tradition and technology. After examining film's close relation to other narrative media such as the novel, painting, photography, television, and even music, the book discusses the elements necessary to understand how films convey meaning, and, more importantly, how we can best discern all that a film is attempting to communicate. In addition, Monaco stresses the still-evolving digital context of film throughout--one of the new sections looks at the untrustworthy nature of digital images and sound--and his chapter on multimedia brings media criticism into the twenty-first century with a thorough discussion of topics like virtual reality, cyberspace, and the proximity of both to film. <br><br>With hundreds of illustrative black-and-white film stills and diagrams, <em>How to Read a Film</em> is an indispensable addition to the library of everyone who loves the cinema and wants to understand it better.<br></p><p><br><strong>James Monaco</strong> is a writer, publisher, and producer.

So does her father the kingpin and a few other shady characters. Spenser and hawk head to Vegas to find Anthony Meeker and to confirm their suspicion that all these people aren&#39;t just missing Anthony&#39;s smile. And Spenser has to make some sense of some very disorganized crime...</p><p>Robert B. Parker was the author of more than fifty books. He died in January 2010.Spenser and Hawk search for the son-in-law of a Boston crime boss; trips to Las Vegas and investigations of organized crime ensue. Regrettably, Burt Reynolds&#39;s performance doesn&#39;t match the quality of the story. His vocal characterizations of Spenser are fine, but his interpretation of Hawk seems an odd choice, and a couple of his thugs sound very much like a bad Bogart impression. Reynolds captures the wry tone of the novel. But his poor vocal characterizations for secondary figures ultimately cancel out the good points of his performance. M.A.M.

Since the accident at the Chernobyl power plant, there has been a detailed analysis of the radioactivity of the food and territory of your population point. The results show that living and working in your village will cause no harm to adults or children.</em></p><p>So began a pamphlet issued by the Ukrainian Ministry of Health&#x2015;which, despite its optimistic beginnings, went on to warn its readers against consuming local milk, berries, or mushrooms, or going into the surrounding forest. This was only one of many misleading bureaucratic manuals that, with apparent good intentions, seriously underestimated the far-reaching consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear catastrophe.</p><p>After 1991, international organizations from the Red Cross to Greenpeace sought to help the victims, yet found themselves stymied by post-Soviet political circumstances they did not understand. International diplomats and scientists allied to the nuclear industry evaded or denied the fact of a wide-scale public health disaster caused by radiation exposure. Efforts to spin the story about Chernobyl were largely successful; the official death toll ranges between thirty-one and fifty-four people. In reality, radiation exposure from the disaster caused between 35,000 and 150,000 deaths in Ukraine alone.</p><p>No major international study tallied the damage, leaving Japanese leaders to repeat many of the same mistakes after the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011. Drawing on a decade of archival research and on-the-ground interviews in Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus, Kate Brown unveils the full breadth of the devastation and the whitewash that followed. Her findings make clear the irreversible impact of man-made radioactivity on every living thing; and hauntingly, they force us to confront the untold legacy of decades of weapons-testing and other nuclear incidents, and the fact that we are emerging into a future for which the survival manual has yet to be written.</p></p><p><strong>Kate Brown</strong> is an award-winning historian of environmental and nuclear history at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Her previous book, <em>Plutopia</em>, won seven academic prizes.

One of the most alarming&#x2015;though also eerily beautiful&#x2015;aspects of Brown&#x2019;s book is her description of the way radioactive material moves through organisms, ecosystems, and human society.... <em>Manual for Survival</em> asks a larger question about how humans will coexist with the ever-increasing quantities of toxins and pollutants that we introduce into our air, water, and soil. Brown&#x2019;s careful mapping of the path isotopes take is highly relevant.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Sophie Pinkham, <em>New York Review of Books</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Brown&#x2019;s in-depth research and clean, concise writing illuminate the reality behind decades of &#x2018;half-truths and bald-faced lies.&#x2019; Readers will be fascinated by this provocative history of a deadly accident and its consequences&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly (starred)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A remarkable book, distinguished by formidable archival history, investigative research, and vivid storytelling. Parts of it grip with the force of a thriller&#x2015;but again and again, the plot is proved true. A decade&#x2019;s work has gone into uncovering the real human cost of Chernobyl. Yet this is a book about even bigger subjects than the disaster at its core: about how politics processes disaster, about the unseen legacies of the &#x2018;friendly atom,&#x2019; and about the Anthropocene futures faced by the human species, surviving in an epoch of ruin.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Robert Macfarlane, author of <em>The Old Ways</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Kate Brown presents a convincing challenge to the official narrative of the Chernobyl disaster. Deeply reported and elegantly written, <em>Manual for Survival</em> is chilling.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Elizabeth Kolbert, Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning author of <em>The Sixth Extinction</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Combining the skills of a historian, investigative reporter, and detective, Kate Brown has blown the lid off the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster and decades of official efforts to suppress its grim truths. Disturbing in its conclusions, destined to incite controversy, <em>Manual for Survival</em> is first-rate historical sleuthing.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>J. R. McNeill, coauthor of <em>The Great Acceleration</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Gripping...Kate Brown&#x2019;s relentless, tenacious reporting shows that Chernobyl isn&#x2019;t the past at all. Nothing, she makes clear, can stop its radiation from seeping through all attempts to bury the truth for a long time to come.

Written during his first term as governor of Virginia, Notes on the State of Virginia is at once a scientific discourse, an attempt to define America, and an examination of the idea of freedom. With the same genius and clear, flexible prose style that informs the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson chronicles Virginia&#39;s natural, social, and political history. In his introduction to this annotated edition, which discusses the work&#39;s origins and composition, Frank Shuffelton focuses particularly on Jefferson&#39;s response to contemporary scientific writings on &#34;New World degeneracy&#34;, his differing treatment of blacks and Native Americans, and his influential role in creating a mythicized American self-image.</p><h2>Onward Towards Our Noble Deaths</h2><p><p><b>A landmark publishing event of one of Japan's most famous cartoonists</b></p><p>Shigeru Mizuki is the preeminent figure of <i>Gekiga </i>manga and one of the most famous working cartoonists in Japan today&#x2013;a true living legend. <i>Onward Towards Our Noble Deaths </i>is his first book to be translated into English and is a semiautobiographical account of the desperate final weeks of a Japanese infantry unit at the end of WorldWar II.

In a day when refinement of method and quality of experience are the guiding lights for many Christians, James Torrance points us to the indispensable <em>who</em> of worship, the triune God of grace. Worship is the gift of participating through the Spirit in the incarnate Son's communion with the Father, writes Torrance. This book explodes the notion that the doctrine of the Trinity may be indispensable for the creed but remote from life and worship. Firmly rooted in Scripture and theology, alive with pastoral counsel and anecdote, Torrance's work shows us just why real trinitarian theology is the very fiber of Christian confession.</p><p>James B. Torrance (1923-2003) was professor emeritus of systematic theology at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland. He also served as a parish minister at Invergowrie (Dundee, Scotland) and as a lecturer at New College, University of Edinburgh.

Born in the 50&#39;s, they were both raised in the northeast, and both showed early signs of being generally fascinated by human behavior. As a child, Katherine Crowley spent hours reading books about astrology and famous movie stars from the 1930&#39;s. She combed over the biographies of such film icons as Jean Harlow, Vivien Leigh and Spencer Tracy. &#34;I was intrigued by the public victories and personal tragedies they endured.&#34;People at work too often get emotionally hooked into tolerating and taking care of co-workers who are unproductive, annoying, needy, or destructive. Break free of such energy drains with the strategies offered by these two authors, who are both passionate and full of energizing ideas. They suggest stress management to help restore composure and balance but also ask you to carry out remedies such as documenting misbehavior and insisting that policies be enforced to correct problems. Take control of your work life by studying your company's ground rules, taking action when possible, and managing your co-dependent tendencies when they're provoked.

Maybe it was a week ago. Maybe it was today. Maybe you don&#x2019;t like tomatoes and have no interest in eating them. But science is interested in tomatoes. Specifically, science is interested in breaking the tomato down into its component parts, isolating the parts that seem to do some good for human health, and then testing whether they really do or not. It&#x2019;s a fascinating process, but does it translate to anything that will help you decide whether or not to put a tomato on your salad?</p><p>One of the things science has figured out about tomatoes is that they contain a phytonutrient called lycopene that gives them their red color. Science has also demonstrated that lycopene in particular seems to have cardioprotective health benefits. Interesting, right? In fact, recently, in 2014, a study was published in Advanced Nutrition that compared tomato intake to lycopene supplements (lycopene taken out and isolated and put into a capsule) to see which had a more beneficial effect on markers of cardiovascular disease.1 And guess who won? The tomato! The study concluded that tomatoes have more positive impact on human health than supplements.</p><p>This is all very exciting--and great news. I always love reading about a new study that supports the notion food can influence health. However, what does this information actually have to do with you? The study doesn&#x2019;t tell you what to do with tomatoes. The scientists don&#x2019;t come to your house and consider your life, and advise you about tomatoes. Are you supposed to lay the tomatoes on your chest at night and hope the magic happens? Are you supposed to eat them for every meal for the rest of your life to ensure you won&#x2019;t ever have a heart attack? Or is the occasional tomato enough to benefit you? What is the dosage of tomatoes? And what are the specific benefits you can count on? And furthermore, can you ever really know whether tomatoes, for you as a unique individual with an unprecedented biochemistry, will actually make any difference at all?</p><p>What happens in a lab does not (and cannot, by its very nature) possibly predict what will happen when you, with your individual body, metabolism, and circumstances, eat a tomato or any other food. Are you even prone to heart disease? If you are, is your body able to get the lycopene out of the tomato and send it where it needs to go? Can you grab those cardioprotective elements from that tomato in the same way some other random person on the street could or couldn&#x2019;t?</p><p>Food can do profound things for you, but you have to have a body that can use it properly to enact those protections and healing compounds. You have to have a body that is set up for creating health out of food. You have to have a metabolism that works. You can deliver a giant pile of 2 x 4s to a building site and they can be the highest quality, most dense, and sturdiest oak available, but if the workers don&#x2019;t show up or have never been trained in how to build a house, that wood is going to sit there and rot. The quality doesn&#x2019;t matter if the house can&#x2019;t get built. Or what if it&#x2019;s a log cabin to be constructed and the only thing delivered were steel beams? That won&#x2019;t help in getting a log cabin built.</p><p>It&#x2019;s exactly the same with &#x201c;power foods.&#x201d; You have to have a body that can take those raw materials and actually make the magic happen. Health is an equation, and it is not as simple as eating a tomato, or taking a pill, or going for a walk, or any other one thing, but it isn&#x2019;t too complicated for us to understand, either.</p><p>So what are you struggling with? Is it low energy, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), or menopausal symptoms, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), indigestion, high cholesterol, or even a chronic disease like diabetes or an autoimmune disorder? No matter what it is, you probably already know you need to do something different. Maybe you have seen a doctor, or maybe you want to try achieving better health on your own, but either way you need a prescription. I&#x2019;m not talking about a pharmaceutical prescription. I&#x2019;m talking about a food prescription--one that can have a greater, more lasting, and more restorative effect than anything else you ever do for yourself.</p><p>The term for prescription so often used by doctors and pharmacists is Rx, but what &#x201c;Rx&#x201d; actually stands for is the Latin word recipere, which means &#x201c;recipe.&#x201d; A food prescription is a recipe for health. The foods you choose and when you eat them can change everything about your energy level, your mood fluctuations, your changing body shape, the numbers on your lab tests like blood pressure and cholesterol, and even the course of chronic diseases that may have already gotten a foothold in your system.</p><p>How can food be so powerful? Because food integrates with your body to create health in a powerful way. I like to explain this using an equation so simple that at first it may seem less significant than it actually is: E + M = H. I repeat:</p><p>&nbsp;E + M = H</p><p>Here&#x2019;s what it means:</p><p>E + M = H</p><p>Eating &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metabolism &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health</p><p>Exercise &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metabolic pathways &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeostasis</p><p>Environment &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harmony</p><p>E is what you eat, how much you Exercise, and the Environment in which you live, breathe, move, and think. Both eating and exercise create your internal environment, but E is also your external environment, influenced by everything around you, from your family and friends to your job, to what you do with your free time, even to the weather. E is everything you put into your body, everything you do with your body, and everything with which you surround your body.</p><p>M is your metabolism, or your rate of converting food into energy. It is also your Metabolic Pathways, which are the many possible roads down which micronutrients (that come from what you eat) travel. Finally, M is the &#x201c;Me&#x201d; in the equation--you as an individual, your genetic makeup, your belief systems, your life experiences. This is how your individual body works and what it is doing at any given moment. Your metabolic pathways are the result of biochemical decisions in your body and what they do. For example, you have a metabolic pathway that controls what your body does with sugar. You have one that controls what your body does with hormones. You have another one that controls how your body processes toxins, from substances like medications and pollution. You even have one that translates your thoughts into physical reactions and causes tissues to secrete hormones. All of these influence the M and make you who you are. M is what happens inside you.</p><p>H is Health. Health doesn&#x2019;t always mean you are disease free. Instead, it means your body has created a Homeostasis, or internal balance. It means you are living in Harmony with a body that is naturally in a constant state of healthy adaptation or flux. It is the end result of how you combine E with M. It is how you feel right now and how well your body is working. Maximizing the H is what we all hope and strive for, and what we will accomplish with the information in this book&#x2019;s pages.</p><p>E + M = H. This equation applies and is working for (or against) you all the time, from your first to your last day on this earth. What science knows is true, even though this knowledge doesn&#x2019;t always trickle down into clinical practice, is that what you eat and do (your environment) combined with your individual metabolism and how well your metabolic pathways function (the &#x201c;me&#x201d;) determine your health status, your body&#x2019;s ability to maintain homeostasis, and your state of harmony in the present moment.&nbsp;</p><p>Although we&#x2019;re talking about equations, I&#x2019;m not trying to create a teacher-student dynamic. We are on this journey together. Now, the focus is on your self-discovery. Together we will explore what the equation means in your life as the formula holds the key to impacting how you feel, the way you look, what your lab reports say, and how healthy you are today and moving forward. Your health depends on two things: E and M. What you do to your body (eating, exercise, and the environment you provide), and what your body is doing to run things (metabolism, metabolic pathways) and be who it is (&#x201c;me&#x201d;), creates how well you are able to live (health). Your internal and external environments combined with your individual makeup and the way your body runs directly result in the quality of your health. E + M = H.&nbsp;</p><p>When you embrace the implications of E + M = H, you will understand that you have the power to change how your body works--how it feels, how it looks, and how it functions. Depending on what problem you have right now (crushing fatigue, hormonal or digestive issues, metabolic syndrome or diabetes, or autoimmunity), you can use specific food prescriptions to change your internal environment, thereby altering your metabolism in a way that addresses the problem (fills you with energy, balances your hormones, heals your digestion, balances your blood sugar and insulin, or even calms your overactive immune response). Because everyone has a different &#x201c;M&#x201d; (metabolism, metabolic pathways, &#x201c;me&#x201d;) no one &#x201c;E&#x201d; (eating plan, exercise, environment) is right for everyone to create health (and homeostasis and harmony). No two metabolisms work in exactly the same way to create a healthy body, and no two bodies are the same. This is why eating on its own cannot create health.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, what you eat profoundly influences your metabolism, which is why metabolic intervention alone (such as with pharmaceuticals) cannot create true health. You need both variables working in concert. The diet industry hasn&#x2019;t embraced this formula yet, and so many people&#x2019;s health would be positively impacted if they would. Instead, they will tell you that E = H. That is, Eating = Health, or even worse, they will tell you to &#x201c;eat less, exercise more,&#x201d; and that will be the ticket to health. They promote the concept that a particular diet (often one that eliminates a food group, such as carbs or meat, or that slashes calories) will fix everyone&#x2019;s problems. That for some crazy reason, doing less will result in health (or at least weight loss).</p><p>We hear a lot of crazy health rumors. Maybe you&#x2019;ve heard that if you eat an apple a day, you will keep the doctor away. That if you eat chia seeds and raw cacao, and breathe out of alternating nostrils, you can cure every disease you&#x2019;ve ever had. They can have valid effects, but until you repair your metabolic pathways using food strategically, these health strategies aren&#x2019;t going to do much for you. (Although I have to admit, raw cacao brings me joy!) What good is the energy in an apple if you can&#x2019;t metabolize the sugar? What good are the nutrients in chia seeds or raw cacao if you can&#x2019;t absorb them? What good is the stress-reducing power of alternate-nostril breathing if your body isn&#x2019;t recognizing the relaxation response? Fix the pathways first. Then you can actually benefit from that apple and the many other &#x201c;super foods&#x201d; and strategies that science says can impact your risk of heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer&#x2019;s, advanced aging, and other chronic diseases.&nbsp;</p><p>Many doctors, and for sure drug companies, are more likely to see the formula like this: M = H. That is, metabolism, or what your body is or isn&#x2019;t doing, determines your health. Your lab reports say your body is pooling cholesterol in the blood, your LDLs are high; this means you are not metabolizing cholesterol, and many doctors are likely to say that to change those numbers, you need a statin drug. Many physicians may even believe it has nothing to do with what you eat. Doctors often say (even to me) that a certain health problem is not related in any way to diet--that it is a genetic or age-related problem. Have you ever been told (or just believed) that you will get diabetes, that you will probably get heart disease because it runs in your family, that you will have early-onset menopause because your mother did, or that you come from a long line of individuals with depression and therefore that is your destiny? You might possess those genes, but it is the alteration in the metabolic pathways that stimulates the expression of them. I&#x2019;ve had healthy debates with many doctors who tell me that the issue for the client we are talking about has nothing to do with food. I&#x2019;m surprised every time. What your metabolism does is directly impacted by the food you eat, how and when you eat it, and in what combination you eat it with other nutrients. How is this not obvious to everyone? E can&#x2019;t = H and M can&#x2019;t = H. You need both E and M to achieve health. E + M = H.</p><p>In my practice, I encourage a high degree of self-study. Self-discovery, if you will. I want you to become absorbed in what your metabolism is doing by noticing how you feel and react to the foods you eat. Don&#x2019;t worry. You&#x2019;re mine now, and we will explore you together. Let&#x2019;s look at the things you commonly do--even the thoughts you think, the sleep you are or are not having, and the deep desires you have for your health. I want us to look at your current E (eating, environment, exercise) and what we can define about your M (metabolism), so that we can recognize how they are affecting your H. I need you to become a little bit self-centered on your own behalf, but don&#x2019;t worry; I will be standing next to you evaluating that reflection in the mirror.</p><p>This may go against everything you think you are supposed to do and be. You may feel selfish, but trust me--this kind of self-examination is the foundation for health and the ultimate key to being there for everyone else. Just imagine that I am sitting across the desk from you, saying, &#x201c;Welcome to my office. I am so excited to get to know you. Tell me all about yourself. How do you feel? What has changed recently? What&#x2019;s bothering you? What is your body doing? How do you wish you felt? How is your chemistry? What are your bowel movements, libido, energy, and sleep like? How is your immune system? Your blood sugars? What are you doing to and for your body?&#x201d; and of course, &#x201c;What do you crave? And what are you eating?&#x201d;</p><p>1 B.M.

Arguing that it was one of the most important of the postwar twentieth-century decades, despite its reputation as an eminently forgettable period, Schulman reconstructs public events and private lives, high culture and low, analyzing not only presidential politics and national policy but also the broader social and cultural experiences that transformed American life. Here are the names, faces, and movements that gave birth to the world we now live in-from Nixon and Carter to <i>The Godfather</i> and the Ramones; from Billie Jean King and Phyllis Schlafly to NOW and the ERA; from the Energy Crisis to Roe v.

He lives in Massachusetts.<b>Introduction</b><p>The Sixties and the Postwar Legacy</p><p>The Seventies began, of course, in the wake of "the Sixties" and have remained ever since in their shadow -- the sickly, neglected, disappointing stepsister to that brash, bruising blockbuster of a decade. "The sober, gloomy seventies," as one journalist put it, "seemed like little more than just a prolonged anticlimax to the manic excitements of the sixties." Sure, pundits constantly debate the era's parameters, suggesting that the "real Sixties" did not begin until the escalation of the war in Vietnam, the riots in Watts, or the Summer of Love, or that they lasted until Nixon's resignation, the fall of Saigon, the breakup of the Beatles or release of "The Hustle." But they agree on a common portrait -- the same mug shot of the Sixties as a time of radical protest and flower power, polarization, experimentation, and upheaval. Depending on one's point of view, they are the source of everything good or everything evil in contemporary life.</p><p>If one date delineated the end of the Sixties and the beginning of the Seventies, it was the year 1968. It struck many observers, then and now, as a revolutionary moment. Nineteen sixty-eight marked simultaneously an <i>annus mirabilis</i> and an <i>annus horribilus,</i> a year of miracles and a year of horrors. For many it seemed to be the Year of the Barricades, to quote the title of one book on the tumultuous events of 1968. Certainly, violent confrontations between the generations erupted around the world. In France, left-wing students occupied the University of Paris. Led by a man known simply as Danny the Red, students seized parts of the Sorbonne and clashed with police on the streets of the Latin Quarter. On May 13, huge crowds marched in protest against the sitting government, against university regulations, against the distribution of wealth and power in French society. Prime Minister Georges Pompidou warned that "our civilization is being questioned -- not the government, not the institutions, not even France, but the materialistic and soulless modern society." He compared the chaotic scene to the "hopeless days of the 15th century, where the structures of the Middle Ages were collapsing."</p><p>Rebels manned a different sort of barricade a few hundred miles to the east. In Prague, the capital of communist-dominated Czechoslovakia, student protests in late 1967 had blossomed into the Prague Spring -- a buoyant, defiant, just plain ballsy challenging of the Soviet-backed regime. The Prague Spring offered a small dose of political opening and a cultural renaissance, inspired by rock music and avant-garde poetry. And then, horribly, Soviet tanks trampled those hopes, rumbling into Czechoslovakia to re-install a hard-line communist dictatorship.</p><p>Across the Atlantic, the United States would not prove immune to violent confrontation. An explosion of racial outrage after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., brought smashed windows and tense confrontations between police and protesters within a few blocks of the White House. A few weeks later, radical students at Columbia University in New York City brought the barricades into the ivory tower. The Columbia unrest unfolded at a time of growing student protest across the country -- against the war in Vietnam, against restrictive campus policies, and against traditional curricula and courses. At Columbia, violent protests led to the cancellation of final exams and an early end to spring semester. The campus revolt also convinced many Americans that revolution was at hand -- that young radicals had moved from mere protest toward power. They would seize control of "the machine," if it would not cease to pursue inhumane ends.</p><p>The Sixties appeared as a historical divide, a decade of turmoil with the future hanging in the balance. But the era, and its climactic twelve months, have also been recalled, as "the Year the Dream Died" -- the year, to quote one journalist, "when for so many, the dream of a nobler, optimistic America died, and the reality of a skeptical conservative America began to fill the void."</p><p>In April, an assassin murdered Martin Luther King, Jr., the man most closely associated with such noble dreams. After King's death, his vision of racial harmony -- even the modest hope of the races living side by side in peace -- evaporated. 1968 marked the fourth consecutive year of massive racial violence in America's cities. The end was nowhere in sight, and indeed a race war on the nation's streets seemed a real possibility.</p><p>Certainly African Americans displayed growing frustration at the slow pace of reform. Militance bubbled through the nation's black neighborhoods, fueled by the radical black nationalism of organizations such as the Black Panther party and leaders like Stokely Carmichael. "When white America killed Dr. King," Carmichael warned after the shooting in Memphis, "she declared war on black America and there could be no alternative to retribution....Black people have to survive and the only way they will survive is by getting guns."</p><p>At the same time, white backlash mounted in the nation's cities and suburbs, a seething resentment most powerfully revealed in the enthusiasm for the independent campaign of George C. Wallace. In 1968, the Alabama governor famous for his stand-off with Martin Luther King during the Selma marches launched a third-party campaign for president. Wallace combined his hostility to civil rights with a populist contempt for the high and mighty. Champion of the little guy, he denounced "briefcase totin' bureaucrats," pointy-headed intellectuals, and federal judges who wouldn't mind their own business. Crowds roared approval as the governor mocked "Yale Ph.D.s who can't tie their own shoelaces, hypocrites who if you opened their briefcases you'll find nothing in them but a peanut butter sandwich."</p><p>In September 1968, national polls showed Wallace with the support of nearly 25 percent of American voters; the Alabama governor was running strong not only in the white South, where his defense of racial segregation had made him a hero, but also in the urban North. In Rustbelt cities, Wallace's advocacy of law and order, contempt for antiwar protesters, and opposition to further civil rights advances won him the admiration of many working-class white ethnics. The early Sixties vision of peaceful, nonviolent reform -- of ending poverty and racism -- evaporated.</p><p>In their distress, many Americans looked to a leader who could heal the nation's wounds. They found their man in Senator Robert F. Kennedy, out on the campaign trail for president. On the night of King's assassination, Bobby Kennedy rejected his wife's advice to cancel his scheduled appearance in Indianapolis and instead addressed the crowd. Kennedy paid tribute to King's life and work and then appealed directly to his audience. "For those of you who are black and are tempted to be filled with hatred and distrust at the injustice of such an act, against all white people, I can only say that I feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling. I had a member of my family killed." But, the candidate pleaded, "we have to make an effort to understand, to go beyond these rather difficult times....What we need in the United States is not division," Bobby concluded. "What we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence or lawlessness, but love and wisdom and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country, whether they be white or they be black."</p><p>Kennedy resuscitated the hopes for peaceful, meaningful reform. His campaign, after tough fights across the country, faced its decisive test in the June California primary -- the contest that would likely decide whether he could win his party's nomination for president. Kennedy won the primary, addressed the cheering crowd in his campaign hotel, and headed toward the press room for interviews. On the way, a young man fired a snub-nosed revolver at Bobby from point-blank range. He collapsed onto his back. Five others fell in the hail of bullets. All of them would survive. But the next day, after three hours of surgery and other heroic efforts to revive him, Robert Kennedy died.</p><p>If those assassinations did not extinguish the extravagant hopes of the era, one small, historically insignificant event in the fall of 1968 signaled the end of the optimistic, liberal 1960s. On October 20, thirty-nine-year-old Jacqueline Kennedy, widow of the martyred president, married a sixty-two-year-old Greek shipping magnate, Aristotle Socrates Onassis. The mystery of this event -- why would she? how could she? -- shocked the nation for weeks. Comedian Bob Hope made light of it. Referring to Spiro Agnew, the Greek-American governor of Maryland running for vice president on the Republican ticket, Hope jested, "Nixon has a Greek running mate and now everyone wants one." For most, it was no laughing matter but the tawdry end of Camelot. The shining knight had died, and now the swarthy villain carried off his noble lady. The dream that was the 1960s, it seemed, had died. The stormy, uncertain Seventies had begun.</p><p><b>The End of "The Great American Ride"</b></p><p>Its drama aside, 1968 should not be torn from the fibers and wrappings of history; its real significance lay as a cultural divide. The last days of the Sixties signaled the end of the post-World War II era, with its baby boom and economic boom, its anticommunist hysteria and expansive government, and the beginning of another age, the long 1970s, which defined the terms of contemporary American life. After two decades of postwar prosperity, Seventies Americans took for granted a set of political assumptions, economic achievements, and cultural prejudices. But after 1969 Americans entered a disturbing new world.

It is a study of how big corporate power uses private wealth to legislate, shape unequal race relations, broker ideas, and define "acceptable" social change. Drawing on little-known biographies of White power brokers who shaped Black education, William Watkins explains the structuring of segregated education that has plagued the United States for much of the 20th century.

The city stood over seven thousand feet up, on an island near the shore of a great lake. It was two hundred miles from the sea to the west, a hundred and fifty to the east. The lake lay in the centre of a broad valley surrounded by magnificent mountains, two of which were volcanoes. One of these was always covered by snow: "O Mexico, that such mountains should encircle and crown thee," a Spanish Franciscan would exult a few years later. The sun shone brilliantly most days, the air was clear, the sky was as blue as the water of the lake, the colours were intense, the nights cold.<br><br>Like Venice, with which it would be insistently compared, Tenochtitlan had been built over several generations. The tiny natural island at the centre of it had been extended to cover 2,500 acres by driving in stakes, and throwing mud and rocks into the gaps. Tenochtitlan boasted about thirty fine high palaces made of a reddish, porous volcanic stone. The smaller, single-storey houses, in which most of the 250,000 or so inhabitants lived, were of adobe and usually painted white. Many of these had been secured against floods by being raised on platforms. The lake was alive with canoes of different sizes bringing tribute and commercial goods. The shores were dotted with well-constructed small towns which owed allegiance to the great city on the water.<br><br>The centre of Tenochtitlan was a walled holy precinct, with numerous sacred buildings, including several pyramids with temples on top. Streets and canals led away straight from the precinct at all four points of the compass. Nearby stood the Emperor's palace. There were many minor pyramids in the city, each the base for temples to different gods: the pyramids themselves, characteristic religious edifices of the region, being a human tribute to the splendour of the surrounding volcanoes.<br><br>Tenochtitlan's site made it seem impregnable. The city had never been attacked. The Mexica had only to raise the bridges on the three causeways which connected their capital to the mainland to be beyond the reach of any plausible enemy. A poem demanded:<br><br>Who could conquer Tenochtitlan?<br><br>Who could shake the foundation of heaven...?<br><br>Tenochtitlan's safety had been underpinned for ninety years by an alliance with two other cities on, respectively, the west and east sides of the lake -- Tacuba and Texcoco. Both were satellites of Tenochtitlan, though Texcoco, the capital of culture, was formidable in its own right: an elegant version of the language of the valley, Nahuatl, was spoken there. Tacuba was tiny, for it may have had only 120 houses. These two places obeyed the Emperor of the Mexica in respect of military affairs. Otherwise they were independent. The royal houses, as there is no reason not to call them, of both were linked by blood with that of Tenochtitlan.<br><br>These allies helped to guarantee a mutually advantageous lacustrine economy of fifty or so small, self-governing city states, many of them within sight of one another, none of them self-sufficient. Wood was available for fire (as for carved furniture, agricultural tools, canoes, weapons, and idols) from the slopes of the mountains; flint and obsidian could be obtained for some instruments from a zone in the north-east; there was clay for pottery and figurines (a flourishing art, with at least nine different wares) while, from the shore of the lake, came salt, and reeds for baskets.<br><br>The emperors of Mexico dominated not only the Valley of Mexico. Beyond the volcanoes, they had, during the previous three generations, established their authority to the east as far as the Gulf of Mexico. Their sway extended far down the coast of the Pacific Ocean in the west to Xoconocho, the best source of the much-prized green feathers of the quetzal bird. To the south, they had led armies to remote conquests in rain forests a month's march away. Tenochtitlan thus controlled three distinct zones: the tropics, near the oceans; a temperate area, beyond the volcanoes; and the mountainous region, nearby. Hence the variety of products for sale in the imperial capital.<br><br>The heartland of the empire, the Valley of Mexico, was seventy-five miles north to south, forty east to west: about three thousand square miles; but the empire itself covered 125,000 square miles.<br><br>Tenochtitlan should have been self-confident. There was no city bigger, more powerful, or richer within the world of which the people of the valley were informed. It acted as the focus for thousands of immigrants, of whom some had come because of the demand for their crafts: lapidaries, for example, from Xochimilco. A single family had ruled the city for over a century. A "mosaic" of altogether nearly four hundred cities, each with its own ruler, sent regular deliveries to the Emperor of (to mention the most important items) maize (the local staff of life) and beans, cotton cloaks and other clothes, as well as several types of war costumes (war tunics, often feathered, were sent from all but eight out of thirty-eight provinces). Tribute included raw materials and goods in an unfinished state (beaten but not embellished gold), as well as manufactured items (including amber and crystal lip plugs, and strings of jade or turquoise beads).<br><br>The power of the Mexica in the year 1518 or, as they called it, 13-Slate, seemed to rest upon solid foundations. Exchange of goods was well established. Cocoa beans and cloaks, sometimes canoes, copper axes, and feather quills full of gold dust, were used as currency (a small cloak was reckoned as worth between sixty-five and a hundred cocoa beans). But payments for services were usually made in kind.<br><br>There were markets in all districts: one of these, that in the city of Tlatelolco, by now a large suburb of Tenochtitlan, was the biggest market in the Americas, an emporium for the entire region. Even goods from distant Guatemala were exchanged there. Meantime, trade on a small scale in old Mexico was carried on by nearly everyone, for marketing the household's product was the main activity of family life.<br><br>The Mexican empire had the benefit of a remarkable lingua franca. This was Nahuatl: in the words of one who knew it, a "smooth and malleable language, both majestic and of great quality, comprehensive, and easily mastered". It lent itself to expressive metaphors, and eloquent repetitions. It inspired oratory and poetry, recited both as a pastime and to celebrate the gods. An equally interesting manifestation was the tradition of long speeches, <i>huehuetlatolli,</i> "words of the old men", learned by heart (as was the poetry) for public occasions, and covering a vast number of themes, usually affording the advice that temperance was best.<br><br>Nahuatl was an oral language. But the Mexica, like the other peoples in the valley, used pictographs and ideograms for writing. Names of persons -- for example, Acamapichtli ("handful of reeds") or Miahuaxochitl ("turquoise maize flower") could always be represented by the former. Perhaps the Mexica were moving towards something like the syllabic script of the Maya. Even a development on that scale would not have been able to express the subtleties of their speech. Yet Nahuatl was, as the Castilian philologist, Antonio de Nebrija had, in the 1490s, described Castilian, "a language of empire". Appropriately, the literal translation of the word for a ruler, <i>tlatoani,</i> was "spokesman": he who speaks or, perhaps, he who commands <i>(huey tlatoani,</i> emperor, was "high spokesman"). Mexican writers could also express elegiac melancholy in a way which seems almost to echo French poetry of the same era:<br><br>I am to pass away like a faded flower<br><br>My fame will be nothing, my renown on earth will vanish.<br><br>Nahuatl, its foremost modern scholar has passionately said, "is a language which should never die".<br><br>Beautiful painted books (usually called codices) recorded the possession of land, as of history, with family trees and maps supporting the inclination of the ancient Mexicans to be litigious. The importance of this side of life can be gathered from the 480,000 sheets of bark paper regularly sent as tribute to "the storehouses of the ruler of Tenochtitlan".<br><br>The politics of the empire were happily guaranteed by the arrangements for imperial succession. Though normal inheritance customarily passed from father to son, a new emperor, always of the same family as his predecessor, was usually his brother, or cousin, who had performed well in a recent war. Thus the Emperor in 1518, Montezuma II, was the eighth son of Axay�catl, an emperor who died in 1481. Montezuma had followed an uncle, Ahu�tzotl, who had died in 1502. In the selection of a new ruler, about thirty lords, together with the kings of Texcoco and Tacuba, acted as an electoral college. No succession so decided seems to have been challenged, even if sometimes there had been rival candidates. (Vestiges of this method of election can be detected by the imaginative in modern methods of selecting the President of Mexico.) Disputes were avoided since each election of a ruler was accompanied by the nomination of four other leaders, who in theory would remain in their places throughout the reign of an emperor, and of whom one would become the heir. No doubt the actual duties of these officials ("Killer of Men", "Keeper of the House of Darkness") had become detached from the titles just as the "Chief Butler of the King" had ceased in Castile to have much to do with the provision of wine. The system of succession varied in nearby cities: in most of them, the ruler was hereditary in the family of the monarch, though in some places the kingship did not always fall to the eldest son. In Texcoco primogeniture was the rule.<br><br>It is true that the deaths of the last three emperors had seemed a little odd: Ahu�tzotl died from a blow on the head when fleeing from flood waters; Tizoc was rumoured to have been killed by witches; and Axay�catl died after defeat in battle. Yet there is nothing to prove that in fact they did not die from natural causes.<br><br>The Mexican emperor stood for, and concerned himself with, the external face of the empire. Internal affairs were ultimately directed by a deputy emperor, a cousin, the <i>cihuacoatl,</i> a title which he shared with that of a great goddess, and whose literal translation, "woman snake", connected him with the feminine side of divinity. The word gives an inadequate picture of his multifarious duties. Probably in the beginning this official was the priest of the goddess whose name he had.<br><br>The internal life of Tenochtitlan was stable. It was in practice managed by an interlocking network of something between a clan, a guild and a district, known as the <i>calpulli,</i> a word about whose precise nature every generation of scholars has a new theory, only agreeing that it indicated a self-governing unit, and that it held land which its members did not own, but used. It was probably an association of linked extended families. In several <i>calpultin</i> (that being the plural style) families had the same professions. Thus featherworkers mostly lived in Amantlan, a district which may once have been an independent village.<br><br>Each <i>calpulli</i> had its own gods, priests, and traditions. Marriage (celebrated in old Mexico with as much ceremonial as in Europe) outside the <i>calpulli,</i> though not impossible, was unusual. The <i>calpulli</i> was the body which mobilised the Mexica for war, for cleaning streets, and for attending festivals. Farmers of land which had been granted by the <i>calpulli</i> gave a proportion of the crops (perhaps a third) to that body for delivery to the imperial administration. Through the <i>calpulli,</i> the farmer heard the requests, or the orders, of the Emperor. There were perhaps as many as eighty of these in Tenochtitlan. Earlier, the leader, the <i>calpullec,</i> had apparently been elected but, by the fifteenth century, that office had become hereditary and lifelong. He too had a council of elders to consult, just as the Emperor had his more formally contrived advisers.<br><br>The most powerful <i>calpulli</i> was that in the suburb known as Cueopan, where there lived the so-called long-distance merchants, the <i>pochteca.</i> These had a bad name among Mexica: they seemed to be "the greedy, the well-fed, the covetous, the niggardly...who coveted wealth". But they were officially praised: "men who, leading the caravans of bearers, made the Mexican state great". Knowing that they were the object of envy, they were secretive. They served the Mexica as spies: telling the Emperor the strengths, the weaknesses and the wealth of the places which they saw on their journeys.<br><br>These merchants, who imported Tenochtitlan's raw materials, as well as the luxury goods from both the temperate zone and the tropics, antedated the empire in their organisation. Much of their work consisted of the exchange of manufactured objects for raw materials: an embroidered cloak for jade; or a gold jewel for tortoiseshells (used as spoons for cocoa). These great merchants lived without ostentation, dressed badly, and wore their hair down to their waists. Yet they had many possessions. They were even referred to by the Emperor as his "uncles"; and their daughters were sometimes concubines of monarchs.<br><br>Important though the merchants were, the supremacy of the Mexica in the valley and beyond had been won by their soldiers. These warriors were both well organised and numerous: the rulers were said to have waited till their population was large before challenging the Tepanecs, to whom they had previously been subject, in 1428. Boys in Mexico were prepared for war from birth in a way which both Spartans and Prussians would have found congenial. At baptisms (the process of naming a child included the use of water sprinkled on the infant, and the placing of water over the heart, so the Christian word is appropriate) the midwife, taking the male child from the mother, would announce that he "belongs to the battlefield, there in the centre, in the middle of the plains". Male children's umbilical cords were buried in places facing where the enemy might be expected. "War is thy desert, thy task..." the midwife would tell the newborn boy, "perhaps thou wilt receive the gift...[of] the flowered death by the obsidian knife" (that is, by sacrifice, as a prisoner of war).<br><br>The weapons of war were present too at christenings: the bow and arrow, the sling, the stone-headed wooden spear. Those weapons, along with the club and the <i>macuauhuitl,</i> a two-edged sword of black obsidian blades set in oak (they cut "like a razor from Tolosa", one conquistador would say), had given these armies their victories. The sign (glyph) for government in Nahuatl was a depiction of a bow and arrow, a round shield (of tightly arranged feathers on a wooden, or cane, backing), and a throwing stick <i>(atlatl,</i> used to launch spears -- at fish as well as at men). The best cloaks and the richest jewels were obtained as prizes for valour, not by purchase. Any male who failed to respond to the call to go to war lost all status, even if he were the son of the Emperor ("he who does not go to war will not consort with the brave" was a Spanish chronicler's formulation of the principle). Promotion in the army (and hence a social rise generally) depended on capturing a specific number of captives: an event consummated by special insignia. Membership of the knightly orders, the "jaguars" and the "eagles", was a supreme dis...</p><h2>Womb Awakening: Initiatory Wisdom from the Creatrix of All Life</h2><p>Rediscover the lost ancient mystery teachings of the Cosmic Womb <br><br>� 2017 Nautilus Silver Award<br><br>� Explains how each of us has a holographic blueprint of the Womb of Creation, our spiritual Womb<br><br>� Offers practices to help awaken your spiritual Womb, experience the Womb of God within, and activate the Womb&#x2019;s sacred magic of creation and manifestation<br><br>� Looks at the power of the moon and its connection to sacred Womb Consciousness<br><br>� Explores how the lost Womb mystery teachings were encoded in folk and fairy tales, the legends of the Holy Grail, and the traditions of Mary Magdalene and Sophia<br><br>� Includes access to three guided Womb Awakening audio journeys<br><br>The Ancients lived by a feminine cosmology of creation, where everything was birthed and dissolved through a sacred universal Womb.

Hanning&#x2019;s</b> <b>Introduction to <i>The Canterbury Tales</i></b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The twenty-first-century reader of <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> experiences Chaucer&#x2019;s tale collection in a manner very different from any the poet could have imagined. What we read today in carefully prepared printed editions may not correspond to what Chaucer wanted his poem to look like; indeed, it seems doubtful that he even had a final plan for its contents and order. He probably began to compose a collection of tales quite different from the monothematic, classically oriented stories comprising <i>The Legend of Good Women</i>&#x2014;but like it, a collection headed by a considerable prologue&#x2014;sometime in the late 1380s, before or after he left London for Kent. How long he worked on The Canterbury Tales is unknown&#x2014;perhaps until illness or death interrupted his labors, but he may have abandoned the project much earlier. Other unanswerable questions: Did he ever really contemplate writing 120 tales, as is implied by the Host&#x2019;s suggestion to the Canterbury-bound pilgrims that each of the thirty travelers tell two tales on the road to the shrine and two more on the way back to the celebratory dinner at his inn, the Tabard? (Elsewhere in the framing fiction there are suggestions that one tale will suffice from each pilgrim.) And how many of the tales had been written and either circulated in writing or performed orally before the poet had the idea of incorporating them within a frame? (A list of his works included by Chaucer in the prologue to the <i>Legend</i> suggests that &#x201c;The Knight&#x2019;s Tale&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Second Nun&#x2019;s Tale of Saint Cecilia&#x201d;* preexisted the <i>Canterbury</i> collection, and various scholars have conjectured an earlier composition for a number of others.)</p><p>What modern presentations of <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> hide behind their neatness and precision is the state in which Chaucer&#x2019;s <i>Canterbury</i> project actually comes down to us. More than eighty extant manuscripts contain all or part of the text; each has variants and errors because, as with all textual reproduction before the invention of printing, manuscripts were copied one at a time by scribes in differing states of attentiveness or fatigue. Scholars have been unable to work out a system that organizes the manuscripts in such a way as to discover, behind all the variant readings, exactly what Chaucer wrote.</p><p>Only one manuscript of <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> (the so-called Hengwrt manuscript, now in the National Library of Wales) may date from Chaucer&#x2019;s lifetime; it contains a highly accurate text but lacks a tale (that of the Canon&#x2019;s Yeoman) and several passages linking tales that appear in other manuscripts written within a decade of Chaucer&#x2019;s death. The most famous manuscript, and until recently the one accorded highest authority because of its completeness and illustrations of all the pilgrims, is the Ellesmere manuscript, now in the Huntington Library in San Marino, California. What emerges from these and other manuscripts is that Chaucer gathered many of the tales into groups, or fragments, by means of interstitial dialogue between the pilgrims. There is no agreed order for these fragments, and some manuscripts omit genuine linking dialogues, while others contain obviously spurious links. So except for the first fragment&#x2014;containing the so-called &#x201c;General Prologue,&#x201d; the Knight&#x2019;s, Miller&#x2019;s, and Reeve&#x2019;s tales, and the Cook&#x2019;s unfinished tale&#x2014;which comes first in all manuscripts that contain it, we cannot be absolutely sure about how Chaucer intended to order his stories&#x2014;if indeed he ever settled on an order or, for that matter, on a text. All the evidence suggests that when he died, or abandoned work on <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>, he left behind piles of papers containing versions of the tales, but that he had also, during his years of composing them, circulated individual stories among his readership that he may later have revised, leaving different versions in circulation to be copied after his death into the manuscripts we now possess. It follows that a cloud of uncertainty, varying in extent and density, must hang over all critical judgments about the meaning and effect of this radically incomplete, but still quite brilliant, collection of tales within their framing fiction.</p><p></p></p><h2>Practicing History</h2><p><b>Celebrated for bringing a personal touch to history in her Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning epic<i>The Guns of August</i> and other classic books, Barbara W.

The substantial Introduction is his best exposition of his general philosophy of art. In Part I he considers the general nature of art as a spiritual experience, distinguishes the beauty of art and the beauty of nature, and examines artistic genius and originality. Part II surveys the history of art from the ancient world through to the end of the eighteenth century, probing the meaning and significance of major works. Part III (in the second volume) deals individually with architecture, sculpture, painting, music, and literature; a rich array of examples makes vivid his exposition of his theory.<br></p><p>G. W. F.

The outwardly simple narrative of an office clerk who kills an Arab, 'a cause du soleil', and finds himself condemned to death for moral insensibility becomes, in Camus's hands, a powerful image of modern man's impatience before Christian philosophy and conventional social and sexual values. For this new edition Ray Davison makes use of recent critical analysis of <em>L'Etranger </em>to give a full and concise description of Camus's early philosophy of the Absurd and the ideas and preoccupations from which the novel emerges. Davison also discusses the developing pattern of Camus's notion of the art of the novel, his views on 'classicism', simplicity and ambiguity, his fondness for paradox, and his love of everyday situations which yield to mythical interpretation. </p></p><p>Albert Camuswas born in Algeria in 1913.

Georgics. Aeneid: Books 1&#x2013;6 (Loeb Classical Library)</h2><p><p>Virgil (Publius Vergilius Maro) was born in 70 BCE near Mantua and was educated at Cremona, Milan and Rome. Slow in speech, shy in manner, thoughtful in mind, weak in health, he went back north for a quiet life. Influenced by the group of poets there, he may have written some of the doubtful poems included in our Virgilian manuscripts. All his undoubted extant work is written in his perfect hexameters. Earliest comes the collection of ten pleasingly artificial bucolic poems, the <i>Eclogues</i>, which imitated freely Theocritus's idylls. They deal with pastoral life and love. Before 29 BCE came one of the best of all didactic works, the four hooks of Georgics on tillage, trees, cattle, and bees. Virgil's remaining years were spent in composing his great, not wholly finished, epic the <i>Aeneid</i>, on the traditional theme of Rome's origins through Aeneas of Troy. Inspired by the Emperor Augustus's rule, the poem is Homeric in metre and method but influenced also by later Greek and Roman literature, philosophy, and learning, and deeply Roman in spirit. Virgil died in 19 BCE at Brundisium on his way home from Greece, where he had intended to round off the <i>Aeneid</i>. He had left in Rome a request that all its twelve books should be destroyed if he were to die then, but they were published by the executors of his will.</p><p>The Loeb Classical Library edition of Virgil is in two volumes.</p></p><p><p>Henry Rushton Fairclough (1862&#x2013;1938) was Professor of Classical Literature at Stanford University.</p><p>G.

So I guess it makes sense that my mother wanted it so badly. I can imagine how her eyes lit up when she walked through the five-�bedroom, three-�and-�a-�half-�bath new construction. I&#x2019;ll bet she thinks this house is the answer to what&#x2019;s wrong with us.<br><br> When Tom, my stepfather, showed me the bathroom attached to my room with its own Jacuzzi tub, he said, Bet you feel like Cinderella, because he&#x2019;s an idiot.<br><br> I should be happy for my mother and Tom, because the old house took so long to sell that it nearly destroyed their marriage. I should be thrilled I don&#x2019;t have to hear the words terrible real estate market and bad location ever again. Neither they nor the listing agent had the balls to come out and say that no one wanted to buy a home on the street of horrors.<br><br> The worst thing about the new house is that there&#x2019;s no way to sneak into my room. The dining room is right off the front hall, so when I get home from dance team tryouts, I can see my mother at the table eating Chinese takeout with Tom and Petey, their &#x201c;oops baby.&#x201d;<br><br> Petey is ten now. Mom married Tom when I was five. When I was a kid, I overheard her telling my grandmother that she and Tom both were done with children. Mom had Jen and me, and Tom had a college-�aged daughter with his ex-�wife. Four months later, Mom was pregnant with Petey.<br><br> So, totally an oops baby.<br><br> &#x201c;Monica,&#x201d; my mother calls. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re eating dinner.&#x201d;<br><br> In other words, Don&#x2019;t you try to disappear upstairs.<br><br> I plod into the dining room, the smell of the takeout souring my stomach. Everything hurts: standing, walking, sitting.<br><br> At the table, Petey is sucking up lo mein noodles. One slips from between his lips and falls on the screen of his iPad, because God forbid he perform a basic function such as eating without playing Clan Wars.<br><br> &#x201c;Petey,&#x201d; Mom says, &#x201c;please put the game down.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But I have to harvest my crops.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Do you want the iPad to go in the garbage?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You wouldn&#x2019;t throw an iPad in the garbage.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Peter.&#x201d;<br><br> Petey&#x2019;s eyes go wide, because Mom only uses his full name when she&#x2019;s really about to lose her shit. I almost want to tell the poor kid it&#x2019;s not his fault that Mom is acting like a psycho.<br><br> &#x201c;Monica.&#x201d; Tom looks up from his phone, finally noticing me. He takes off his reading glasses and breathes on the lenses. Wipes them on his shirt. &#x201c;How were tryouts?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Fine.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The new Chinese place gave us extra fortune cookies!&#x201d; Petey says, and I say, &#x201c;Cool,&#x201d; which pretty much sums up the depth of my interactions with my half brother.<br><br> Mom&#x2019;s eyes are on me. I keep my own eyes on a carton of white rice. I grab a plate and spoon some onto it.<br><br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d; Petey asks. It takes a second for it to sink in that he&#x2019;s speaking to me. Tom is watching me now too. My mother makes a face as if she just swallowed down vomit.<br><br> &#x201c;Can I go lie down?&#x201d; I ask.<br><br> &#x201c;Go ahead,&#x201d; she says.<br><br> When I get to the hall, I hear Petey whine, &#x201c;How come she gets to do what she wants?&#x201d;<br><br> I practically have to crawl up the stairs to my room. The over-�the-�counter painkillers my mom picked up for me are seriously garbage. I would call Matt, my �ex-�boyfriend, because even though he denies it, he&#x2019;s friends with people who can get the strong stuff. But Matt graduated and he&#x2019;s not in Sunnybrook anymore and we haven&#x2019;t spoken since July.<br><br> My heating pad is still packed in one of the storage tubs Mom and I bought from Bed Bath&nbsp;&amp; Beyond before the move. I dig it out, biting my lip. The nurse at Dr. Bob&#x2019;s office said it would be like bad period cramps. But it hurts so badly I want to die.<br><br> I break into a sweat from plugging in the heating pad and flop onto my brand-�new bed. King-�sized, like my mom and Tom&#x2019;s. She insisted&#x2014;�the room would have looked too small with a queen.<br><br> They say you&#x2019;re not supposed to put the pad directly on your skin, but I do it anyway and curl up on my side. I&#x2019;d gladly take my flesh melting off over the pain in my gut.<br><br> A knock at the door. I grunt and Mom pushes her way in, holding a bottle of naproxen and a glass of water. &#x201c;When was the last time you took painkillers?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Lunch,&#x201d; I lie.

Warren Hollister nurtured this classic text of medieval European history. The text was profoundly marked by his clear historical vision and engaging teaching style. Now Judith Bennett has updated this classic book while striving to lose neither Dr. Hollister&#39;s vision nor style. In his preface to the eighth edition, Professor Hollister wrote of his fateful realization, while in college, that our world today &#34;is a product of the medieval past.&#34; The ninth edition of Medieval Europe: A Short History seeks to introduce today&#39;s students to the medieval roots of our own society. Building on the solid foundation created by Dr. Hollister, new co-author Judith Bennett brings expanded coverage of women&#39;s history, social and cultural history, the role of the common man and woman of the Middle Ages, and the history of the Late Middle Ages to this revision.</p><p>C. Warren Hollister was Professor Emeritus of History at the University of California, Santa Barbara, received his BA from Harvard University and his MA and PhD from UCLA. A Fellow of the Medieval Academy of America, the Royal Historical Society (London), the Medieval Academy of Ireland, the Australian National University, the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation, and Merton College, Oxford, he was founder and past president of the Charles Homer Haskins Society and served as President of the Pacific Coast Conference on British Studies, the Medieval Association of the Pacific, the American Historical Association, Pacific Coast Branch, the North American Conference on British Studies, and was 1984 Centennial Program Chair of the American Historical Association, Chair of the University of California Press Editorial Board, and Chair of the national Development Committee for the College Board Advanced Placement Test in European History. Professor Hollister&#x2019;s many books have run through more than thirty editions and have been translated into several languages. He has also written some fifty articles on medieval history.

In <i>Girls on the Edge, </i>Dr. Leonard Sax shares stories of girls who look confident and strong on the outside but are fragile within. He shows why a growing proportion of teen and tween girls are confused about their sexual identity and obsessed with grades or Facebook. Sax provides parents with tools to help girls become confident women, along with practical tips on helping your daughter choose a sport, nurturing her spirit through female-centered activities, and more.<i><i> </i></i></p><p><b>Leonard Sax, M.D., Ph.D.</b>, is a graduate of MIT and the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned both his Ph.D. (in psychology) and his M.D. He is board-certified in family medicine. His scholarly work has been published in a wide variety of journals, including <i>American Psychologist</i>,&nbsp;<i>Behavioral Neuroscience</i>, <i>Environmental Health Perspectives,&nbsp;</i>and the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>. He has been a featured guest on CNN, PBS, The TODAY Show, Fox News, NPR's Talk of the Nation, and many other national and international programs. He lives with his wife and daughter in suburban Philadelphia.In Boys Adrift (2007), Sax, a family physician and psychologist with more than 20 years of experience, explored the disturbing trend of young men who are disengaged from their lives. In this companion volume, he turns to the other half of the population and identifies four factors that are threatening the mental and physical health of young women today: a culture that sexualizes young girls; the &#x201c;cyberbubble&#x201d; of social networking and electronic communication; obsessive behaviors, including eating disorders; and environmental toxins that disrupt the endocrine system and lead to early-onset puberty. In clear, accessible language, Sax deftly blends anecdotes, clinical research, and even lines of poetry in persuasive, often fascinating chapters that speak straight to parents; in the book&#x2019;s second half, he offers practical ideas for nurturing girls&#x2019; minds, bodies, and spirits, from advocating for girls&#x2019; athletics programs to making room for prayer in secular households. Warning that &#x201c;a 1980s solution&#x201d; won&#x2019;t help solve twenty-first-century problems, Sax offers a holistic, sobering call to help the current generation of young women develop the support and sense of self that will allow them to grow into resilient adults. And, finally, he counsels parents to be persistent: &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t back away even when she tells you to get lost.&#x201d; Pair this eye-opening title with similar resources listed in the adjacent Read-alikes column, &#x201c;Girl Talk, Part 2.&#x201d; --Gillian Engberg</p><h2>The Developing Person Through the Life Span, 8th Edition</h2><p>Exceptional in its currency, global in its cultural reach, Kathleen Berger&#x2019;s portrait of the scientific investigation of childhood and adolescent development helps bring an evolving field into the evolving classroom.

Her historical novels have charmed and delighted millions of readers for decades, though she rarely reached out to the public to discuss her works or private life. It is known that she was born in Wimbledon in August 1902, and her first novel, The Black Moth, was published in 1921. <br><br>Heyer published 56 books over the next 53 years, until her death from lung cancer in 1974. Heyer's large volume of works included Regency romances, mysteries and historical fiction. Known also as the Queen of Regency romance, Heyer was legendary for her research, historical accuracy and her extraordinary plots and characterizations. Her last book, My Lord John, was published posthumously in 1975. She was married to George Ronald Rougier, a mining engineer, and they had one son together, Richard.<p><b>One</b></p> <p>It was past midnight, and the people who lived in the cottages that clustered round the triangular green had long since gone to bed and to sleep. No lamp shone in any window, but a full moon sailed in a sky the colour of sapphires, and lit the village with a pale light, as cold as the sheen on steel. Trees and houses cast grotesque shadows, black as soot; every object in the moonlight stood out sharply defined, but without colour, so that even a prosaic line of petrol pumps looked a little ghostly.</p> <p>There was a car drawn up at one end of the green, its headlights throwing two golden beams ahead, and its engine throbbing softly. One of its doors stood open. Something moved in the shadow of the great elm tree beside the car; a man stepped into the moonlight, glanced this way and that, as though fearful of seeing someone, and after a moment's hesitation got quickly into the car and began to turn it, jarring his gears a little. He looked once towards the elm tree, at some object dimly discernible in the shadow, and then, having swung the car right round, drove away up the London road. The noise of his engine died slowly in the distance; somewhere at hand a watch-dog barked once, and then was silent.</p> <p>The shadow of the elm tree was shortening as the moon travelled across the sky: the eerie light seemed to steal under the branches, and presently shone on two feet in patent leather shoes, stuck through the holes in a pair of stocks. The feet remained motionless, and as the moonlight crept nearer the glimmer of a white shirt-front showed.</p> <p>An hour later a cyclist rounded the bend in the road by the King's Head. Police-Constable Dickenson was returning home from a night patrol. The moonlight now fully illuminated the stocks. A gentleman in evening-dress was sitting in them, apparently asleep, for his body had sagged forward, his head lolling on his chest. Police-Constable Dickenson was whistling softly as he rode, but the whistle stopped suddenly, and the front wheel of the bicycle swerved. The stocks were a feature of Ashleigh Green, but the Constable could not remember having seen anyone imprisoned in them before. It gave him quite a turn. Tight as an owl, he thought. Looks like somebody's been having a game with you, my lad.</p> <p>He got off his bicycle, and pushed it on to the grass and carefully propped it against the elm tree. The figure on the bench did not move. &#x2018;Now then, sir, wake up!' said the Constable, kind but reproving. &#x2018;Can't spend the night here, you know!' He laid his hand on the sagging shoulder, and gave it a slight shake. &#x2018;Come along, sir, you'll be better off at home, you will.' There was no response, and he shook the shoulder rather harder, and put one arm round the man to hoist him. There was still no response, but an arm which had lain across its owner's knees was dislodged, and hung dangling, the hand brushing limply against the Constable's trousers. The Constable bent, peering into the downcast face, and sought in his pocket for his torch. The light flashed on, and the Constable stepped back rather quickly. The figure on the bench, disturbed by his shaking, toppled over sideways, its feet still held in the stocks. &#x2018;Gawd!' whispered Police-Constable Dickenson, feeling his mouth to be very dry all at once, &#x2018;Oh, Gawd!' He did not want to touch the figure again, or even to go nearer, because there was something sticky on his hands, and he had never seen a dead man before.</p> <p>He stooped, and rubbed his hand on the grass, telling himself he was a proper softy. But he hadn't been expecting it, and his stomach had kind of turned over. Made a chap feel sick for a minute; it was like as if one's innards took a jump into one's chest. Breathing a little jerkily he went up to the figure again, and ran his torch over it, and rather gingerly touched one of the slack hands. It wasn't exactly cold, not clammy, like you read about in books, but just cool. He didn't know but that he wouldn't rather it had been icy. That faint warmth was nasty, somehow.</p> <p>He pulled himself up. It wasn't his job to get fanciful, but to make up his mind what was the right thing for him to do first. The man was dead, sure enough; it was no use standing over the body: he'd better get on to the Police Station at Hanborough as soon as possible. He pushed his bicycle back on to the road, mounted it again, and rode swiftly along to the other end of the green to the cottage with the prim muslin curtains and the tidy flowerbeds which had County Police painted on a narrow board over the front door.</p> <p>He let himself in and made his way to the telephone, taking care to tread softly so that his wife, who was asleep upstairs, should not wake and call to him to go up. He'd have to tell her what had happened if she did, and she was expecting her first, and none too well.</p> <p>He lifted the receiver, wondering whether he'd done the right thing after all, leaving a corpse stuck down in the middle of the village. Didn't seem decent, somehow.</p> <p>The Station-Sergeant's voice spoke. He was surprised to hear his own voice so steady, because he really felt a bit shaken, and no wonder. He told his story as matter-of-factly as he could, and the Sergeant, not nearly so phlegmatic, said first: &#x2018;What?' and then: &#x2018;In the stocks?' and lastly: &#x2018;Look here, are you sure he's dead?'</p> <p>Police-Constable Dickenson was quite sure, and when the Sergeant heard about the blood, and the wound in the back, he stopped making incredulous exclamations and said briefly: &#x2018;All right. You cut along and see no one touches the body. The Inspector will be down with the ambulance in a couple of shakes.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Hold on a minute, Sergeant,' said the Constable, anxious to give all the information he could. &#x2018;It isn't a stranger. I was able to identify him it's Mr Vereker.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Mr Who?' demanded the Sergeant.</p> <p>&#x2018;Vereker. The gentleman from London, as bought Riverside Cottage. You know, Sergeant: comes down week-ends.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh!' said the Sergeant, rather vaguely. &#x2018;Not a local man.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Not properly speaking,' agreed the Constable. &#x2018;But what beats me is how he came to be sitting in them stocks at this hour of night. He's in evening-dress, what's more.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, you get back, and keep your eye on things till the Inspector comes along,' said the Sergeant, and hung up the receiver.</p> <p>Constable Dickenson heard the click of it, and was rather sorry, because now that he had had time to recover from his first amazement he could see several queer things about the murder, and would have liked to have talked them over with the Sergeant. But there was nothing for it but to do as he was told, so he put his receiver back on the hook, and tiptoed out of the house again to where he had left his bicycle propped against the iron railings.</p> <p>When he got back to the stocks the dead man was lying in the same position. There was no sign that anyone had been there since the Constable left, and after looking over the ground for a bit with the aid of his torch, in the hope of discovering some clue, or footprint, the Constable leaned his back against the tree, and tried, while waiting for the Inspector to arrive, to puzzle out the problem for himself.</p> <p>It was not very long before he heard the sound of a car in the distance, and in a few minutes it drew up beside the green, and Inspector Jerrold hopped out nimbly, and turned to give a hand to a stout man in whom the Constable recognised Dr Hawke, the Police-Surgeon.</p> <p>&#x2018;Well,' said the Inspector briskly. &#x2018;Where is this body, Dickenson? Oh! ah!' He stepped up to the bench, and ran his torch over the still figure there. &#x2018;H'm! Not much for you here, Doctor, from the looks of it. Turn those headlights this way, Hill. That's better. Like this when you found him, was he?'</p> <p>&#x2018;No sir, not properly. He was sitting up well, when I say sitting, he was kind of slouching forward, if you know what I mean. I thought he was asleep. Him being in evening-dress, and his feet in the stocks like that, I never thought but what he's had a glass too many so I went up to him and put my hand on his shoulder to give him a bit of a shake and wake him up. Twice I shook him, and then it struck me there was something queer about him, and I felt the palm of my hand kind of wet and sticky, and I switched my torch on him and then of course I saw he was dead. Me shaking him like that made him fall sideways, like you see.'</p> <p>The Inspector nodded, his eyes on the Doctor, who was kneeling behind the body. &#x2018;Sergeant Hamlyn says you identified him. Who is he? Don't seem to know his face.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, I daresay you might not, sir. It's Mr Vereker, of Riverside Cottage.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh!' said the Inspector with a little sniff. &#x2018;One of those week-end people. Anything out of the way, Doctor?'</p> <p>&#x2018;I shall have to do a PM, of course,' grumbled the Doctor, getting up rather ponderously from his knees. &#x2018;But it looks quite a straight case. Knife wound a little below the left shoulder-blade. Death probably occurred instantaneously.'</p> <p>The Inspector watched him at work on the body for a moment or two, and presently asked: &#x2018;Formed any opinion of the time it was done, sir?'</p> <p>&#x2018;Say two to four hours,' replied the Doctor, and straightened his back. &#x2018;That's all for the present, thanks.'</p> <p>The Inspector turned to Constable Dickenson. &#x2018;Know how the body was sitting when you found it?'</p> <p>&#x2018;Yes, sir.'</p> <p>&#x2018;All right. Put it back as near as you can. Ready with that flashlight, Thompson?'</p> <p>Constable Dickenson did not care much for the task allotted him, but he went up at once to the body and raised it to the original position, and carefully laid one arm across the stiffening legs. The Inspector watched him in silence, and, when he stepped back at last, made a sign to the photographer.</p> <p>By the time the photographer had finished his work the police ambulance had arrived, and a light was turned on in one of the windows of an adjacent cottage. The Inspector cast a shrewd glance up at the window and said curtly: &#x2018;Right. You can take him out now. Careful how you touch that bar! We may get a finger-print.'</p> <p>The bar of the stocks was raised, the body lifted out and carried to the ambulance, just as the lighted window was thrown up and a tousled head poked out. A ghoulishly expectant voice called out: &#x2018;What's the matter? Has there been an accident? Anybody hurt?'</p> <p>&#x2018;Just a bit of an accident, Mrs Duke,' replied Constable Dickenson. &#x2018;Nothing for you to worry about.'</p> <p>The head was withdrawn, but the voice could be heard adjuring one Horace to get up quick, because the police were outside with an ambulance and all.</p> <p>&#x2018;What I know of this village, we'll have a whole pack of busybodies here inside of ten minutes,' said the Inspector, with a grim little smile. &#x2018;All right, you men: mortuary. Now then, Dickenson, let's hear what you can tell us. When did you discover the body?'</p> <p>&#x2018;By my reckoning, sir, it would be about ten minutes to two. It was just on two when I rung up the Station, me having been out on patrol.'</p> <p>&#x2018;You didn't see anyone here? No car? Didn't hear anything?'</p> <p>&#x2018;No, sir. Nothing.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Was the man what's his name Vereker, staying at Riverside Cottage?'</p> <p>&#x2018;Not to my knowledge he wasn't sir, but then he didn't, not during the week as a general rule. It being Saturday, I figured it out he must have been on his way down to the Cottage. Mrs Beaton would know whether he was there. She'd have had her orders to go in and make things ready for him.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Does she live out?'</p> <p>&#x2018;Yes, sir. Pennyfarthing Row, a couple of minutes from the cottage. She keeps the place clean, and gets in milk and eggs and such, when he's coming down. He often gets down late on Saturdays, so she was telling me. I have known him to bring his valet down to do for him, but just as often he comes alone.' He paused, and corrected himself. &#x2018;When I say alone, I mean he often don't bring a servant with him.'</p> <p>&#x2018;What do you mean?' inquired the Doctor.</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, sir, he sometimes bring friends down with him.' He gave a little cough. &#x2018;Most often females, so I've heard.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Wife? Sister?' interrupted the Inspector.</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh no, sir! Nothing like that,' replied the Constable, rather shocked.</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, that kind of female!' said the Inspector. &#x2018;We'd better go round first thing in the morning to Riverside Cottage, and see if there's anything to be got there. There's nothing here. Ground's too dry for footprints. We'll get along, Doctor, if you're ready. You'll hand in your report to-morrow, Dickenson, see? You can go off to bed now.' He moved away towards the car with the Doctor. Constable Dickenson heard him say in his dry way: &#x2018;Looks to me like a case for the Yard. London man. Nothing to do with us. Nice easy case too if they can lay their hands on the woman.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Quite,' agreed the Doctor, smothering a yawn. &#x2018;If he had a woman with him.'</p></p><h2>National Audubon Society Field Guide to Fishes, Whales and Dolphins</h2><p>This delightful field guide features 585 full-color photographs of marine and freshwater fishes, 30 photographs and 45 paintings of whales, dolphins, and porpoises, and 24 pictures of freshwater and saltwater habitats. 529 species are described in detailed written accounts-with information on measurements; body shape and color; scales, fins, and gills; habitat; range; and behavior-and 400 other species are briefly noted.

In <i>How Does Analysis Cure? </i>Kohut presents the theoretical framework for self-psychology, and carefully lays out how the self develops over the course of time. Kohut also specifically defines healthy and unhealthy cases of Oedipal complexes and narcissism, while investigating the nature of analysis itself as treatment for pathologies. This in-depth examination of &#x201c;the talking cure&#x201d; explores the lesser studied phenomena of psychoanalysis, including when it is beneficial for analyses to be left unfinished, and the changing definition of &#x201c;normal.&#x201d;<br><br>An important work for working psychoanalysts, this book is important not only for psychologists, but also for anyone interested in the complex inner workings of the human psyche.</p><p>Arnold Goldberg, MD, is a training and supervising analyst at the Institute for Psychoanalysis in Chicago and the Cynthia Oudejan Harris, MD, Professor of Psychiatry at Rush University Medical School.

Through the engaging figure of the handsome Irishman Phineas Finn, Trollope explores the realities of political life, and the clash between compromise and conviction, that is as topical today as it was in the 1860s. In his introduction, Simon Dentith looks at the British political context and the interwoven strands of politics, the rights of women, and their struggle for equality in marriage. He also considers the novel's interesting publishing history and Trollope's own parliamentary ambitions. One appendix outlines the internal chronology of the series, providing a unique understanding of the six novels as a linked narrative, and a second appendix describes the passage of the second Reform Act of 1867, a controversial measure that extended the franchise and was the subject of heated Conservative and Liberal debate. In addition, there is a biography of Trollope and a chronology of his life as well as extensive notes.<br></p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M.

This book seeks to change this. It uncovers the absurd implications of materialism and then, uniquely, presents a hard-nosed non-materialist metaphysics substantiated by skepticism, hard empirical evidence, and clear logical argumentation. It lays out a coherent framework upon which one can interpret and make sense of every natural phenomenon and physical law, as well as the modalities of human consciousness, without materialist assumptions. According to this framework, the brain is merely the image of a self-localization process of mind, analogously to how a whirlpool is the image of a self-localization process of water. The brain doesn't generate mind in the same way that a whirlpool doesn't generate water. It is the brain that is in mind, not mind in the brain. Physical death is merely a de-clenching of awareness. The book closes with a series of educated speculations regarding the afterlife, psychic phenomena, and other related subjects.<br></td></tr></tbody></table></p><p>Bernardo Kastrup has a Ph.D. in philosophy and another in computer engineering.

But was he right? Can the quantum theory of fields and Einstein's general theory of relativity, the two most accurate and successful theories in all of physics, be united in a single quantum theory of gravity? Can quantum and cosmos ever be combined? On this issue, two of the world's most famous physicists--Stephen Hawking (<i>A Brief History of Time</i>) and Roger Penrose (<i>The Emperor's New Mind</i> and <i>Shadows of the Mind</i>)--disagree. Here they explain their positions in a work based on six lectures with a final debate, all originally presented at the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences at the University of Cambridge.</p><br><p> How could quantum gravity, a theory that could explain the earlier moments of the big bang and the physics of the enigmatic objects known as black holes, be constructed? Why does our patch of the universe look just as Einstein predicted, with no hint of quantum effects in sight? What strange quantum processes can cause black holes to evaporate, and what happens to all the information that they swallow? Why does time go forward, not backward?</p><br><p> In this book, the two opponents touch on all these questions. Penrose, like Einstein, refuses to believe that quantum mechanics is a final theory. Hawking thinks otherwise, and argues that general relativity simply cannot account for how the universe began. Only a quantum theory of gravity, coupled with the no-boundary hypothesis, can ever hope to explain adequately what little we can observe about our universe. Penrose, playing the realist to Hawking's positivist, thinks that the universe is unbounded and will expand forever. The universe can be understood, he argues, in terms of the geometry of light cones, the compression and distortion of spacetime, and by the use of twistor theory. With the final debate, the reader will come to realize how much Hawking and Penrose diverge in their opinions of the ultimate quest to combine quantum mechanics and relativity, and how differently they have tried to comprehend the incomprehensible.</p></p><p>Who doesn't love a good argument? When physics heavyweights Stephen W. Hawking and Roger Penrose delivered three sets of back-and-forth lectures capped by a final debate at Cambridge's Isaac Newton Institute, the course of modern cosmological thinking was at stake. As it happens, <i>The Nature of Space and Time</i>, which collects these remarks, suggests that little has changed from the days when Einstein challenged Bohr by refusing to believe that God plays dice. The math is more abstruse, the arguments more refined, but the argument still hinges on whether our physical theories should be expected to model reality or merely predict measurements.<p> Hawking, clever and playful as usual, sides with Bohr and the Copenhagen interpretation and builds a strong case for quantum gravity. Penrose, inevitably a bit dry in comparison, shares Einstein's horror at such intuition-blasting thought experiments as Schr�dinger's long-suffering cat--and scores just as many points for general relativity. The math is tough going for lay readers, but a few leaps of faith will carry them through to some deeply thought-provoking rhetoric. Though no questions find final answers in <i>The Nature of Space and Time</i>, the quality of discourse should be enough to satisfy the scientifically curious. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p><b>Stephen Hawking</b> is Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. <b>Roger Penrose</b> is the Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford. <b>Michael Atiyah,</b> Master of Trinity College Cambridge, and former President of the Royal Society, has written a foreword for this book.</p><h2>Psychotherapy with Infants and Young Children: Repairing the Effects of Stress and Trauma on Early Attachment</h2><p><p></p>This eloquent book presents an empirically supported treatment that engages parents as the most powerful agents of their young children's healthy development.
